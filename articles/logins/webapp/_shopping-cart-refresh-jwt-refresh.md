1. A while later, the user's JWT expires and the user clicks on their shopping cart again. The browser will request the shopping cart from the application backend and will send the JWT and refresh token to the application backend
1. The application backend will verify the JWT and realizes it is expired. Since the browser also sent across the refresh token, the application backend calls the JWT refresh API in FusionAuth with the refresh token.

1. The application backend will respond with the user's shopping cart HTML, CSS & JavaScript that the browser will render. It also includes the new JWT as a cookie that replaces the old JWT in the browser
