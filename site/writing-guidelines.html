          Writing guidelines
        </h1>
        <p>
          Thanks for writing for us. Here are some guidelines to help make the process go smoothly.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We typically look for blog content. You can check <a href='/blog'>the blog out</a> to get a feel. We have a slightly irreverant tone and enjoy posts that tell stories. While we want FusionAuth to play a role in any writing, it doesn't have to be the star. We've found that posts that focus on helping a user with a more general problem like authentication, JWTs or authorization are better recieved than a 'how do I do this with FusionAuth' post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our audience is developers and managers of developers. We want the content to be technical in nature. We have an ongoing list, but are also happy to hear pitches based on your skillset and interests. Some sample ideas:
             <ul>
               <li>
                 How to use OAuth to secure an application written in [language].
               </li>
               <li>
                 Securing [application or framework] with OAuth.
               </li>
               <li>
                 How to use [specific OAuth grant] in [language].
               </li>
               <li>
                 Can you run FusionAuth in Fargate/GKE/Heroku? How?
               </li>
               <li>
                 What's next for OAuth and OIDC?
               </li>
               <li>
                 How I can set up single sign on for [SaaS application], using FusionAuth as the identity provider?
               </li>
               <li>
                 What is the difference between ECC and RSA public key cryptography?

                 What is PKCE and why would you use it?
               </li>
             </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The typical process is:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Contact is made. Please show us an example of your writing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We discuss a few topics based on our needs and your interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We agree on a topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You send over an outline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We give feedback and we discuss the outline, and then I approve it via email.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You write the article.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You deliver it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We give feedback or ask questions after review. Typically we do 1-2 revisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I approve it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I get payment scheduled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We publish the article.
                </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li> 
            Additional guidelines:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Please provide your paypal email address, as that's how we'll pay you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please provide your twitter handle, and we'll tag you when we publish the post.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you'd like to republish the article on your own blog or medium site, you may do so. We ask that you wait a week after we publish it and that you link back to the FusionAuth blog as the location of the original publication.
            </li>
            <li>
              The FusionAuth site is <a href='https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-site/'>open source</a> and uses jekyll so you can run it locally if you'd like.
            </li>
            <li>
              Indent all code blocks with two spaces per level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the authorization code grant if you are working with OAuth (instead of the implicit grant). Please use the "state" parameter to defend against CSRF attacks and PCKE for additional security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure you store all tokens securely, as <a href='/learn/expert-advice/tokens/building-a-secure-jwt#holding-tokens'>outlined here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you make an example application, we'd love to have that transferred over to our github repository, where we'll make it available under the Apache license. If you'd like to add yourself as a contributor in the project readme, please feel free to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              We prefer to have the article delivered in jekyll compatible markdown. If that doesn't work, then google docs is fine, but we still need the images separately.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you provide images or videos, please make them available as a zip file. We post-process images included in our posts.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you take screenshots of the FusionAuth interface, please don't spend a lot of time on making them look good. We re-do them in house with a specific host configuration (using Silicon Vally characters). All you to do is take a screen shot with enough detail that we can recreate it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you make a video of any part of the process, please give us the source file so we can upload it to our youtube channel.
            </li>
            <li>
              We'll notify you when the article is published, and would appreciate any social sharing you can do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please run your article through Google docs grammar and spell checker and correct any errors before submitting it.
            </li>
