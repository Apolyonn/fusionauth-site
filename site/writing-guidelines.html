        Thanks for writing for us. Here are some guidelines to help make the process go smoothly.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide your paypal email address, as that's how we'll pay you.
          </li>
          <li>
            We prefer to have the article delivered in markdown. If that doesn't work, then google docs is fine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the authorization code grant if you are working with OAuth.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make an example application, we'd love to have that transferred over to our github repository, where we'll make it available under the Apache license. If you'd like to add yourself as a contributor in the project readme, please feel free to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you provide images, please make them available as part of a zip file.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you take screenshots of the FusionAuth interface, please don't spend a lot of time on that, as we re-do them in house with a given configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make a video of any part of the process, please give us the source file so we can upload it to our youtube channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            We'll notify you when the article is published, and would appreciate any social sharing you can do.
          </li>
        </ul>
