          Writing guidelines
        </h1>
        Thanks for writing for us. Here are some guidelines to help make the process go smoothly.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The typical process is:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Contact is made.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We discuss a few topics based on our needs and your interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We agree on a topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You send over an outline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I give feedback and we discuss the outline, and then I approve it via email.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You write the article.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You deliver it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I give feedback or ask questions after review. Typically we do 1-2 revisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I approve it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I get payment scheduled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We publish the article.
                </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Please provide your paypal email address, as that's how we'll pay you.
          </li>
          <li>
            We prefer to have the article delivered in markdown with images in a zip file. If that doesn't work, then google docs is fine, but we still need the images separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the authorization code grant if you are working with OAuth. Please use the "state" parameter to defend against CSRF attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you store all tokens securely, as <a href='/learn/expert-advice/tokens/building-a-secure-jwt#holding-tokens'>outlined here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make an example application, we'd love to have that transferred over to our github repository, where we'll make it available under the Apache license. If you'd like to add yourself as a contributor in the project readme, please feel free to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you provide images, please make them available as a zip file. We post-process images included in our posts.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you take screenshots of the FusionAuth interface, please don't spend a lot of time on making them look good. We re-do them in house with a given configuration. Just give us enough information that we can recreate it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make a video of any part of the process, please give us the source file so we can upload it to our youtube channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            We'll notify you when the article is published, and would appreciate any social sharing you can do.
