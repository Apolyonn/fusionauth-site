        <h3><strong>The Modern Guide to OAuth: How OAuth is used in the real world</strong></h3>
        <p>
          There are hundreds of articles and blog posts covering OAuth 2.0, but none of them present the modern, real-world use cases. This guide covers OAuth 2.0 from a real-world perspective and covers modern use cases of the specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide is different than most of the others out there because it covers all of the ways that we actually use OAuth. It also covers all of the details you need to be an OAuth expert without reading all the specifications or writing your own OAuth server. Here's what you'll learn:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The eight common OAuth modes
          </li>
          <li>
            How to use the Authorization Code grant
          </li>
          <li>
            Why you should never use the Implicit grant
          </li>
          <li>
            What problem the Device grant solves
          </li>
        </ul>
