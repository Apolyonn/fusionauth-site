Right or wrong, usernames and passwords have been a critical component of website and application security for years. However, weak passwords can result in a costly data breach if compromised. To help ensure stronger password security, leading organizations like the National Institute for Standards and Technology have published clear criteria to discourage users from selecting easy to guess passwords. We have assembled those criteria into one checklist of key password recommendations to help you evaluate and improve your own password policies.

## Legally Required Password Constraints
According to [Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/ "Jump to Verizon's site"), the overwhelming majority of hacking-related breaches took advantage of stolen and/or weak passwords. To address this risk, many organizations are required by law to enforce strict password constraints. These password requirements are based on extensive study of the mathematical principles of password entropy and are proven to construct stronger passwords. (Read [this post](/TODO-NEED-URL) for more details on calculating password strength.) They combine a variety of strategies including:
- Minimum and maximum character counts
- Uppercase and lowercase letter requirements
- Numeric and special character requirements
- Time-based password resets
- Password re-use policies

Each agency combines these strategies into their own password policy. [In this checklist](https://fusionauth.io/resources/password-security-compliance-checklist.pdf) you'll learn the compliance requirements relating to password security for:
- FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOC2 (Service Organization Control)
- NIST (United States National Institute for Standards and Technology)

While these password requirements won't eliminate all your password issues, they will go a long way to make your system more secure from the most common attacks hackers use to get access. Take advantage of these established requirements in your internal conversations with your engineering and security teams. Download and share the checklist to strengthen your company’s password security policy, minimize the risk of data theft, and ensure you comply with the password requirements of the agencies you  work with.
