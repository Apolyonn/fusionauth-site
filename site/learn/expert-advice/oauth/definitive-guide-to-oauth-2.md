# 1. The Basics

## 1.1. What is OAuth?

**OAuth** is an **O**pen standard for **Auth**orization.

**Authorization** is the act of granting permission.
When an app wants to use your data (location, photos, documents, etc.), it has to ask for permission.
You can choose whether or not to authorize the app, usually by clicking on `Allow` or `Decline`.

**Standard**s are not hard restrictions or specific implementations.
A standard is basically the set of rules that the industry has agreed is best.

**Open** means that the standard is publicly available and open for modification.
You can read the OAuth 2.0 specification [here][RFC6749].
That document defines what OAuth is (along with a healthy ecosystem of recommended tweaks).

So, what is OAuth?
It's an ever-evolving set of guidelines for creating apps that can request permission from users.

## 1.2. How Does OAuth Work?

Imagine fictional compression app Pied Piper wants to let users compress files straight from Google Drive.

Before OAuth, a common "solution" would be for Pied Piper to take each user's Google username and password.
Pied Piper could then log into Google Drive *as the users*, and grab those files.
If your first thought is, "I don't want to give my Google password to random apps," then you already understand why OAuth is an improvement.

With OAuth, Pied Piper can ask a trusted OAuth provider (like FusionAuth) to get consent from the user and from Google Drive.

In a bit more detail:

1. **Pied Piper registers with FusionAuth.**

	Most apps don't handle their own authorization; they use an OAuth provider, like FusionAuth.
	OAuth providers have put in a lot of work to make this easy for you.
	Users' trust in your OAuth provider is trust you don't have to establish on your own.

1. **Pied Piper asks FusionAuth to get consent from the user.**

	When the app wants to access a user's data, it needs to ask for permission.
	The app redirects the user to its OAuth provider; this takes the familiar form of a popup asking the user to click "Allow."
	If the user does click "Allow", the OAuth provider gives the app a **Grant**, which is a receipt for the user's consent.

1. **Pied Piper "logs in" with FusionAuth**

	The app needs to prove that it got consent and that it is who it says it is.
	The app presents the **Grant** to the OAuth provider, as well as its **Secret**.
	If everything looks good to the OAuth provider, the app receives an **Access Token**, which is a ticket that allows the app into specific parts of the user's data for a specific amount of time.

1. **Pied Piper makes an API call to Google Drive.**

	The user's data is accessible via a resource server, which is a locked API; the app needs a ticket to get in.
	When the app makes an API call, it also sends the **Access Token**; the resource server can verify the token's authenticity with the same OAuth provider that issued it.
	If the **Access Token** is legit and hasn't expired, the resource server will send back the data requested in the API call.

## 1.3. How Do I Use OAuth?

If you're here, it's pretty likely that you're interested in using OAuth in your own app.
If you want to get up and running ASAP, check out FusionAuth's [5-Minute Setup Guide].

The specifics vary based on your OAuth provider-of-choice and the individual requirements of your app.
In general, the OAuth flow follows the above 4 step-process; in short, you'll need to:

1. **Registration.**

	After you pick an OAuth provider (like FusionAuth), they'll ask for some basic details about your app.

	You'll get two important pieces of identification: a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
	These are basically your app's username and password.

	You'll also pick a `redirect_uri`; the next step takes users away from your app, so your OAuth provider needs to know how to get them back.

1. **Authorization.**

	When your app needs a user's data, it will need to ask for permission..
	Redirect the user to your OAuth provider's `authorize` endpoint.
	Your OAuth provider will authenticate the user and ask them to click `Allow` or `Deny`.

	Assuming they click on `Allow`, the user will be redirected back to your app (via your `redirect_uri`).
	Your OAuth provider will also send you a `code`.

1. **Code Exchange.**

	A `code` can be exchanged for an `access_token`.
	Make a POST request to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
	This is where your `client_secret` comes in; your OAuth provider will use this to authenticate your app.

	Now that both the app and user have proven their identities and agreed on sharing data, your OAuth provider will send you an `access_token`.

1. **API Request.**

	The only reason you didn't go straight to making API requests for the user's data is because the API wants an `access_token.`
	Now that you have one, you can request away.
	
	When you send an `access_token` to the API, it can in turn send it to your OAuth provider for verification: "is this legit?"
	Once the API is satisfied, it will send you the user's data.

As you read on, refer back to these steps.
This is the skeleton of OAuth; some approaches (or "flows") will add layers on top or remove some bones, but it's always ultimately OAuth underneath.

# 2. Your App

There's more than one way to implement OAuth.
The way described in the previous section is the most common: **Code Flow**.

Before you dive in, you should figure out a few things about your app's restrictions and requirements; maybe one of the other flows is a better fit.

## 2.1. Can Your App Keep a Secret?

### 2.1.1. Server-Based Apps

Server-based apps are also known as "confidential clients," because they can keep a `client_secret` confidential.
Typically, this means they run on a server, with only the UI running on users' computers.

In practice, this means that, in order to use a `client_secret`, any requests to your Oauth provider's `token` endpoint must come from the server your app is installed on.

### 2.1.2. Client-Based Apps

Client-based apps are also known as "public clients," because they are installed or downloaded wholesale onto users' computers, which means the `client_secret` is installed or downloaded onto users' computers.
Info stored on users' computers is considered "public."
If the `client_secret` is public, even temporarily, it can be copied and used to impersonate your app.

In practice, this means that you'll need to use an alternative method for authenticating your app; that's what the PKCE extension is for.
Check out **Code Flow + PKCE**.

## 2.2. How Do Users Interact With Your App?

### 2.2.1. Uh, the Normal Way?

If your users access your app with a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen, then you don't need to worry about **Device Flow** or **Client Credentials Flow**.

### 2.2.2. Through a Smart TV or Other IoT Device

We've all tried typing long usernames and passwords with a TV remote or game controller.
It's not fun.
Luckily, there's a flow just for that; **Device Flow** gives users a short code to type in on their phone or computer.

### 2.2.3. They Don't

If your app doesn't require human consent, it can still utilize OAuth to verify other apps or even itself.
This is often referred to as M2M (machine to machine) interaction.
You'll be needing **Client Credentials Flow**.

# 3. Choosing an OAuth Flow

## 3.1. Code Flow

**Recommended for:** server-based (confidential) apps.

This is the most common and standard flow.
It's not unreasonable to say that the other flows are based on this one.

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#51-code-flow)

## 3.2. Code Flow + PKCE

**Recommended for:** client-based (public) apps.

PKCE (pronounced "pixie") is an extension that allows client-based to use **Code Flow**.
Because client-based apps can't keep a `client_secret`, this flow has you generating and hashing a new, cryptographically random `code_verifier` for every authorization.
Prior to PKCE, client-based apps had to use **Implicit Flow**, which is now deprecated.

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#52-code-flow--pkce)

## 3.3. Device Flow

**Recommended for:** apps installed on devices without keyboards.

If you use device flow, your app with show a `user_code` and `verification_uri` to the user.
Your app will then periodically ask your OAuth provider if the user has navigated to `verification_uri` and entered `user_code` yet.

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#53-device-flow)

## 3.4. Client Credentials Flow

**Recommended for:** apps that don't need human input.

Unsurprisingly, the biggest difference with this flow is that it skips the **Authorization** step, because there is no user to ask.
This means that all your app has to do is trade its `client_id` and `client_secret` for an `access_token`.

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#54-client-credentials-flow)

## 3.5. User Credentials Flow

**Not recommended for most apps.**

This flow has your app taking users' usernames and passwords directly, which is basically what OAuth is designed to prevent.
The danger (from a user's perspective) is that an app could store the credentials to use later, without the users' consent.
Still, this can be useful for apps that have built up a lot of trust with their users, such as those developed by OAuth providers, themselves.

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#55-user-credentials-flow)

## 3.6. Implicit Flow

**Not recommended for most apps.**

This flow is deprecated, and for good reason; it skips the **Code Exchange** step entirely, getting an `access_token` instead of a `code`.
Because the **Authorization** step ends in a redirect, the `access_token` is exposed in the redirect URI parameters; these parameters can easily be copied out of a browser's URL bar.
Anyone who holds your `access_token` is able to make API requests as if they are your app.

Before [CORS] was widely available in modern browsers, this was the only way for client-based apps to avoiding exposing their `client_secret`s.
Now, you're better off using **Code Flow + PKCE**, unless your app is somehow unable to utilize [CORS].

[See how to implement this flow, step-by-step.](#56-implicit-flow)

# 4. Authentication in OAuth

OAuth has no concept of identity; it only specifies methods of authorization.
If you read the OAuth spec, you'll see repeated disclaimers that OAuth is not an authentication framework.
That doesn't mean you don't need it; it just means there's a bit more to learn.

## 4.1. OpenID Connect

The standard for authentication in OAuth is OpenID Connect (OIDC).

OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.
If your OAuth provider is OIDC certified, you can get an `id_token` along with your `code`.
The `id_token` is a signed JWT that contains user profile information, such as name, email address, phone number, etc.
That profile information can be trusted due to the signature, which can be verified by using your OAuth provider's `userInfo` endpoint.

More on JWTs can be seen in the [Using Access Tokens](#6-using-access-tokens) section.

To indicate that you want an ID token, simply include `openid` in the `scope` of your authorization request.

# 5. Implementing OAuth Flows Step-by-Step

## 5.1. Code Flow

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

1. Redirect the user to your OAuth provider's `authorize` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter          | value                                 | purpose                                                                       |
	|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`        | your client ID                        | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request                       |
	| `redirect_uri`     | your redirect URI                     | tells your OAuth provider where to redirect users after authorization is done |
	| `response_type`    | `code`                                | indicates that you're expecting an authorization code in response             |
	| `scope` (optional) | space-separated list of access levels | tells your OAuth provider which specific data you're trying to get            |
	| `state`            | random string                         | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks |

	*Example URI:*

	```
	https://oauth-provider.com/oauth2/authorize?
		client_id=06494b74-a796-4723-af44-1bdb96b48875&
		redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piedpiper.com%2Flogin&
		response_type=code&
		state=E7bMSVO7DlxkFueN&
		scope=openid%20profile%20email
	```

	When the user gets there, your OAuth provider will show a page with your app's name and logo, the scope of the request, an `Allow` button, and a `Decline` button.

	Depending on the implementation, the user will also hit an authentication layer, in which they will log in with username-password, social media, biometrics, or whatever other options your OAuth provider allows.

1. Your Oauth provider will redirect the user to your `redirect_uri` along with some parameters:

	| parameter | value                                                | purpose                                                                       |
	|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `code`    | the authorization code from your OAuth provider      | proof that the user gave consent                                              |
	| `state`   | the same random string you gave in the previous step | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks |

	*Example URI:*

	```
	https://www.piedpiper.com/login?
		code=+WYT3XemV4f81ghHi4V+RyNwvATDaD4FIj0BpfFC4Wzg&
		state=E7bMSVO7DlxkFueN
	```

	Verify that `state` is the same as the one you sent; if it's not, someone other than your OAuth provider is trying to execute a CSRF attack.<!--TODO: link to CSRF attack on wikipedia or something-->
	Save `code` for the next step; you'll need it to get an access token.

1. Make an HTTP request to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter       | value                                           | purpose                                                      |
	|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`     | your client ID                                  | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request      |
	| `client_secret` | your client secret                              | used by your OAuth provider to authenticate your app         |
	| `code`          | the authorization code from your OAuth provider | proof that the user gave consent                             |
	| `grant_type`    | `authorization_code`                            | indicates that you're using an authorization code as a grant |
	| `redirect_uri`  | the same redirect URI as you gave in step 1     | used by the OAuth provider to verify your token request      |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&
	client_secret=_UctTBl5PG89-vCwrOo0FqYLywnUC4hSjx927sLjuzM&
	code=+WYT3XemV4f81ghHi4V+RyNwvATDaD4FIj0BpfFC4Wzg&
	grant_type=authorization_code&
	redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piedpiper.com%2Flogin
	```

1. Your OAuth provider will respond with JSON, including the `access_token`:

	| parameter                  | value                     | purpose                                                     |
	|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token`             | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data           |
	| `expires_in`               | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires |
	| `refresh_token` (optional) | an opaque token           | used to get new `access_tokens` after they expire           |

	*Example JSON:*

	```json
	{
		"access_token" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw",
		"expires_in" : 3600,
		"refresh_token": "ze9fi6Y9sMSf3yWp3aaO2w7AMav2MFdiMIi2GObrAi-i3248oo0jTQ"
	}
	```

	That's the end of the Authentication Grant Flow!
	See [Using Access Tokens](#using-access-tokens) for what to do next.

## 5.2. Code Flow + PKCE

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

1. Generate a new `code_verifier` and `code_challenge` for every request.
The verifier can be any cryptographically random string, and the challenge is a SHA-256 hashed version of that string.
For most environments, libraries exist for both cryptographic randomization and SHA-256.

1. Redirect the user to your OAuth provider's `authorize` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter               | value                                     | purpose                                                                                                               |
	|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`             | your client ID                            | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request                                                               |
	| `code_challenge_method` | `S256`                                    | indicates that you used SHA-256 to hash `code_verifier` into `code_challenge`                                         |
	| `code_challenge`        | SHA-256 hashed version of `code_verifier` | will be compared with `code_verifier` in a later step, which allows your OAuth provider to authenticate your app      |
	| `redirect_uri`          | your redirect URI                         | tells your OAuth provider where to redirect users after authorization is done                                         |
	| `response_type`         | `code`                                    | indicates that you're expecting an authorization code in response                                                     |
	| `scope` (optional)      | space-separated list of access levels     | tells your OAuth provider which specific data you're trying to get                                                    |
	| `state`                 | a random string                           | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks                                         |

	*Example URI:*

	```
	https://oauth-provider.com/oauth2/authorize?
		client_id=06494b74-a796-4723-af44-1bdb96b48875&
		redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piedpiper.com%2Flogin&
		response_type=code&
		code_challenge=E8AD0F7972B90735CDF7E12CB5623027E33DE10B7E7956A8C77E32C16B9532F9&
		code_challenge_method=S256&
		state=E7bMSVO7DlxkFueN&
		scope=openid%20profile%20email
	```

	When the user gets there, your OAuth provider will show a page with your app's name and logo, the scope of the request, an `Allow` button, and a `Decline` button.

	Depending on the implementation, the user will also hit an authentication layer, in which they will log in with username-password, social media, biometrics, or whatever other options your OAuth provider allows.

1. Your Oauth provider will redirect the user to your `redirect_uri` along with some parameters:

	| parameter | value                                                | purpose                                                                       |
	|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `code`    | the authorization code from your OAuth provider      | proof that the user gave consent                                              |
	| `state`   | the same random string you gave in the previous step | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks |

	*Example URI:*

		code=+WYT3XemV4f81ghHi4V+RyNwvATDaD4FIj0BpfFC4Wzg&

	```

	Verify that `state` is the same as the one you sent; if it's not, someone other than your OAuth provider is trying to execute a CSRF attack.<!--TODO: link to CSRF attack on wikipedia or something-->
	Save `code` for the next step; you'll need it to get an access token.

1. Make an HTTP request to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter       | value                                           | purpose                                                                                                                  |
	|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`     | your client ID                                  | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request                                                                  |
	| `code_verifier` | the random string generated in step 1           | will be compared with the `code_challenge` you sent in step 2, which allows your OAuth provider to authenticate your app |
	| `code`          | the authorization code from your OAuth provider | proof that the user gave consent                                                                                         |
	| `grant_type`    | `authorization_code`                            | indicates that you're using an authorization code as a grant                                                             |
	| `redirect_uri`  | the same redirect URI as you gave in step 2     | used by the OAuth provider to verify your token request                                                                  |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&
	code_verifier=zfLfZKs05SjlQOJv&
	code=+WYT3XemV4f81ghHi4V+RyNwvATDaD4FIj0BpfFC4Wzg&
	grant_type=authorization_code&
	redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piedpiper.com%2Flogin
	```

1. Your OAuth provider will respond with JSON, including the `access_token`:

	| parameter                  | value                     | purpose                                                     |
	|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token`             | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data           |
	| `expires_in`               | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires |
	| `refresh_token` (optional) | an opaque token           | used to get new `access_tokens` after they expire           |

	*Example JSON:*

	```json
	{
		"access_token" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw",
		"expires_in" : 3600,
		"refresh_token": "ze9fi6Y9sMSf3yWp3aaO2w7AMav2MFdiMIi2GObrAi-i3248oo0jTQ"
	}
	```

	That's the end of the Authentication Grant Flow +PKCE!

## 5.3. Device Flow

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

1. Make an HTTP request to your OAuth provider's `device_authorize` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter          | value                                 | purpose                                                            |
	|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`        | your client ID                        | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request            |
	| `scope` (optional) | space-separated list of access levels | tells your OAuth provider which specific data you're trying to get |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/device_authorize HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&
	scope=openid%20profile%20email
	```

1. Your OAuth provider will respond with JSON including the following parameters:

	| parameter          | value                                      | purpose                                                                   |
	|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `device_code`      | a random string                            | used by your OAuth provider to identify the user's device                 |
	| `expires_in`       | integer number of seconds                  | number of seconds the user has before `user_code` expires                 |
	| `interval`         | integer number of seconds                  | number of seconds your app should wait between `token` endpoint requests  |
	| `user_code`        | a random string                            | short code for the user to type in after navigating to `verification_uri` |
	| `verification_uri` | URI pointing to your OAuth provider's site | short web address for the user to type in a browser                       |

	*Example JSON:*

	```json
	{
		"device_code": "e6f_lF1rG_yroI0DxeQB5OrLDKU18lrDhFXeQqIKAjg",
		"verification_uri": "https://oauth-provider.com/device",
		"user_code": "FBGLLF",
		"expires_in": 600,
		"interval": 5
	}
	```

	Display `verification_uri` and `user_code` on the device.
	The user will type the URI in another browser and arrive at a page on your OAuth provider's site.
	Your OAuth provider will show a page with your app's name and logo, the scope of the request, and a form to enter the `user_code`.
	(Entering the code is basically the same as clicking `Allow` in [Authorization Code Flow](#authorization-code-flow).)

	Depending on the implementation, the user will also hit an authentication layer, in which they will log in with username-password, social media, biometrics, or whatever other options your OAuth provider allows.

1. Make HTTP requests to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
Because there's no way to know if the user has finished entering the `user_code`, you'll need to check repeatedly.
The `interval` parameter from step 2 tells you how long to wait between requests.

	You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter     | value                       | purpose                                                      |
	|:--------------|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`   | your client ID              | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request      |
	| `device_code` | the device code from step 2 | used by your OAuth provider to identify the user's device    |
	| `grant_type`  | `device_code`               | indicates that you're using a device code as a grant         |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&
	device_code=e6f_lF1rG_yroI0DxeQB5OrLDKU18lrDhFXeQqIKAjg&
	grant_type=device_code
	```

	If the user hasn't typed in their code, yet, your OAuth provider will respond with an `authorization_pending` error:

	```json
	{
		"error": "authorization_pending"
	}
	```

1. Once the user has finished authorizing, your OAuth provider will respond with JSON, including the `access_token`:

	| parameter                  | value                     | purpose                                                     |
	|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token`             | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data           |
	| `expires_in`               | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires |
	| `refresh_token` (optional) | an opaque token           | used to get new `access_tokens` after they expire           |

	*Example JSON:*

	```json
	{
		"access_token" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw",
		"expires_in" : 3600,
		"refresh_token": "ze9fi6Y9sMSf3yWp3aaO2w7AMav2MFdiMIi2GObrAi-i3248oo0jTQ"
	}
	```

	That's the end of the Device Flow!

## 5.4. Client Credentials Flow

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

1. Make an HTTP request to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter          | value                                 | purpose                                                            |
	|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`        | your client ID                        | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request            |
	| `client_secret`    | your client secret                    | used by your OAuth provider to authenticate your app               |
	| `grant_type`       | `client_credentials`                  | indicates that you're using client credentials as a grant          |
	| `scope` (optional) | space-separated list of access levels | tells your OAuth provider which specific data you're trying to get |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&

	grant_type=client_credentials&
	scope=openid%20profile%20email
	```

1. Your OAuth provider will respond with JSON, including the `access_token`:

	| parameter                  | value                     | purpose                                                     |
	|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token`             | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data           |
	| `expires_in`               | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires |
	| `refresh_token` (optional) | an opaque token           | used to get new `access_tokens` after they expire           |

	*Example JSON:*

	}
	```

	That's the end of the Authentication Grant Flow!
	See [Using Access Tokens](#using-access-tokens) for what to do next.

## 5.5. User Credentials Flow

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

1. Get the user's `username` and `password`.
This is usually done with a form.
Don't store these credentials; use temporary variables and throw them out after authorization.

1. Make an HTTP request to your OAuth provider's `token` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter       | value                  | purpose                                                 |
	|:----------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`     | your client ID         | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request |
	| `client_secret` | your client secret     | used by your OAuth provider to authenticate your app    |
	| `grant_type`    | `password`             | indicates that you're using user credentials as a grant |
	| `password`      | `password` from step 1 | used by the OAuth provider to authenticate the user     |
	| `username`      | `username` from step 1 | used by the OAuth provider to authenticate the user     |

	*Example POST request:*

	```
	POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
	Host: oauth-provider.com
	
	client_id=3c219e58-ed0e-4b18-ad48-f4f92793ae32&
	client_secret=_UctTBl5PG89-vCwrOo0FqYLywnUC4hSjx927sLjuzM&
	grant_type=password&
	username=matt-boisseau&
	password=R7qq4YAx3q9S
	```

1. Your OAuth provider will respond with JSON, including the `access_token`:

	| parameter                  | value                     | purpose                                                     |
	|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token`             | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data           |
	| `expires_in`               | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires |
	| `refresh_token` (optional) | an opaque token           | used to get new `access_tokens` after they expire           |

	*Example JSON:*

	```json
	{
		"access_token" : "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw",
		"expires_in" : 3600,
		"refresh_token": "ze9fi6Y9sMSf3yWp3aaO2w7AMav2MFdiMIi2GObrAi-i3248oo0jTQ"
	}
	```

	That's the end of the User Credentials Flow!
	See [Using Access Tokens](#using-access-tokens) for what to do next.

## 5.6. Implicit Flow

[Not sure if this is the right flow for your app?](#3-choosing-an-oauth-flow)

Implicit Flow was designed as a workaround for [public apps](#public-clients) (those that can't keep a confidential secret) before the [CORS] was available in modern browsers.

Implicit Flow simply skips the code exchange step that would require authentication with a client secret.
Instead, you ask for the access token directly in the authorization redirect.
This means that the access token is exposed in the redirect URI parameters (see step 2).
For this reason, Implicit Flow is **not recommended**; instead, you should use [Authorization Code Flow +PKCE](#authorization-code-flow-pkce).

If you still want to use Implicit Flow, keep in mind that tokens should be as short-lived as possible.
When it comes to potentially exposed tokens, less active time means less to gain for would-be attackers.
Refresh tokens are long-lived by design, and are therefore too risky to expose.

1. Redirect the user to your OAuth provider's `authorize` endpoint.
You'll need to include the following parameters:

	| parameter          | value                                 | purpose                                                                       |
	|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `client_id`        | your client ID                        | tells your OAuth provider which app is making a request                       |
	| `redirect_uri`     | your redirect URI                     | tells your OAuth provider where to redirect users after authorization is done |
	| `response_type`    | `token`                               | indicates that you're expecting an access token in response                   |
	| `scope` (optional) | space-separated list of access levels | tells your OAuth provider which specific data you're trying to get            |
	| `state`            | random string                         | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks |

	*Example URI:*

	```
	https://oauth-provider.com/oauth2/authorize?
		client_id=06494b74-a796-4723-af44-1bdb96b48875&
		redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piedpiper.com%2Flogin&
		response_type=token&
		state=E7bMSVO7DlxkFueN&
		scope=openid%20profile%20email
	```

	When the user gets there, your OAuth provider will show a page with your app's name and logo, the scope of the request, an `Allow` button, and a `Decline` button.

	Depending on the implementation, the user will also hit an authentication layer, in which they will log in with username-password, social media, biometrics, or whatever other options your OAuth provider allows.

1. Your Oauth provider will redirect the user to your `redirect_uri` along with some parameters:

	| parameter      | value                     | purpose                                                                       |
	|:---------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| `access_token` | a JWT or opaque token     | used to make API calls and access the user's data                             |
	| `expires_in`   | integer number of seconds | number of seconds the app has before `access_token` expires                   |
	| `state`        | random string             | used to verify the response from your OAuth provider and prevent CSRF attacks |

	*Example URI:*

	```
	https://www.piedpiper.com/login?
		access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw&
		expires_in=600&
		state=E7bMSVO7DlxkFueN
	```

	Verify that `state` is the same as the one you sent; if it's not, someone other than your OAuth provider is trying to execute a CSRF attack.<!--TODO: link to CSRF attack on wikipedia or something-->

	That's the end of the Implicit Flow!

# 6. Using Access Tokens

After successfully using one of the above authorization grant flows, you should have an access token, which is either an opaque token or a JWT.

## 6.1. Opaque Tokens

An opaque token is really just a randomly generated string.
It doesn't contain any info on its own; instead, it works only as an API key.
Include an access token with your requests to the resource server; the resource server will use the token to validate the request.

*Example opaque token:*

```
ppRbXeycI6Wu0K9WzbgGQadUoS7P
```

## 6.2. JWTs

A JWT contains base64-encoded JSON data, which can be retrieved by manually decoding or passing the JWT back to your OAuth provider's `introspect` endpoint.
The JSON payload might include data like the user's roles, which authentication type they used, their email address, etc.
A JWT can also be included with API requests, just like an opaque token.

*Example encoded JWT:*

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTc3ODYyMDAwLCJleHAiOjE1Nzc4NjIwMDAsInJvbGVzIjpbIm1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVzZXIiXX0.oinbs9H_CzT7Bl79ZL_tHLmfE53YyTlUFv284il_YCw
```

A JWT is separated into three parts with `.`s.
Each part is base64-encoded.

The first chunk is the header, which tells us basic info about the JWT, like the algorithm used to hash it, and its filetype.

*Example decoded JWT header:*

```json
{
	"alg": "HS256",
	"typ": "JWT"
}
```

The second chunk is the payload, which might include data like the user's roles, which authentication type they used, their email address, etc.

*Example decoded JWT payload:*

```json
{
	"exp": 1577862000,

A JWT also has a digital signature, which means that the data within can be verified and trusted.
They can be signed using a shared secret (known to both your OAuth provider and the resource server or a public/private key pair (with private kept by the OAuth provider to ensure it stays confidential).
In the example below, `oF0125yWqU*^` is the shared secret.

*Example decoded JWT signature:*

```
HMACSHA256(
	base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
	base64UrlEncode(payload),
	oF0125yWqU*^
)
```
