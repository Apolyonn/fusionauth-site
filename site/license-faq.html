          While the exact terms of your use of FusionAuth are spelled out in the <a href='https://fusionauth.io/license/'>license agreement</a> and you should definitely have your lawyer read it, we wanted to provide a more human readable version.

          (That said, if there is any conflict between this FAQ and the license agreement, the license agreement wins.)

          <h2>What does the FusionAuth license apply to?</h2>
          <p>
            The FusionAuth license applies to the FusionAuth bundle fusionauth-app which is used by all of our installation methods (ZIPs, DEBs, RPMs, Docker, K8s, etc). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The fusionauth-search bundle is vanilla ElasticSearch, and is covered by the <a href='https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/LICENSE.txt'>version appropriate ElasticSearch license</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            All other code such as client libraries and example applications are covered under their own licenses, which are usually Apache 2.0. Refer to each project for the correct license.

          <h2>I am reselling FusionAuth to my customers. What type of license do I need?</h2>

            You will need a reseller license for FusionAuth in order to resell it to your customers. This license is usually charged per customer rather than per monthly active user. You should contact our sales team to discuss licensing options. They can be reached at sales@fusionauth.io.

          <h2>What about the GDPR? Do you have a standard data processing agreement?</h2>
          <p>
            We have a standard DPA (Data Processing Addendum) we can provide. However, we only execute DPAs with Enterprise Edition customers with a contract in place. You should contact our sales team to discuss DPA options. They can be reached at sales@fusionauth.io.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides a DPA, you can always reference our license and privacy policies in your documentation. Here are the URLs for those documents:

            If you have a support contract, please file a ticket and we’ll get it fixed. If you have found a bug, please <a href='https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues'>open a GitHub issue</a>.

            Nope. If you have a feature you'd like added, please let us know. The best way to do that is to file a support ticket if you have a support contract. Otherwise, please <a href='https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues'>open a GitHub issue</a> detailing the feature request.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you change anything within FusionAuth, we won't guarantee it will continue to work as expected, or at all.

          <h2>Can I decompile the source code?</h2>
          <p>
            Nope. The source code for the fusionauth-app bundle and all closed source libraries owned by FusionAuth cannot be decompiled or reverse engineered. This prevents companies from forking FusionAuth and creating their own solution to sell to their customers (i.e. like Amazon has done with ElasticSearch).

            Yes.

          <p>
            We release example apps, supporting libraries and documentation under the Apache2 license, and those are modifiable as specified by that license.

          <p>
            This FAQ only applies to the code distributed under the FusionAuth license.
