### Overview

FusionAuth is a fast growing, privately held startup headquartered in Denver Colorado. We are expanding our team to help accelerate our growth and take FusionAuth to the next level.

Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer, and to make developers successful integrating FusionAuth to their applications.  If you have development experience and want to move to a customer facing, business oriented role, FusionAuth might be a perfect fit for you. This is an opportunity for you to make a difference.

We are recruiting a Sales Engineer who will assist new prospective customers. This role will work directly with inbound sales leads to demonstrate the value FusionAuth provides and be a trusted resource through the sales process.  Our customers are usually technical, and you will lead technical interactions,  demos and problem solving to determine feasibility. Youâ€™ll need to bring your coding background with Java (or similar) experience building back end systems. Helpful will be experience setting up authentication, and some knowledge of OAuth, SAML, OIDC, SSO, MFA, and other IAM standards.

You will report directly to the VP of Sales and will work mostly remote from home, with occasional visits to our Denver office (dependent on your location).

Your responsibilities will include:

* Engage with prospective customers through demonstrations, design sessions, architecture reviews, workshops, and on-boarding sessions
* Assist prospective customers with FusionAuth configuration, implementation, and deployment
* Engage with technical and non-technical employees of prospective customers and various levels and build a strong value proposition for FusionAuth
* Engage with the FusionAuth Community Forum, Slack, StackOverflow and elsewhere
* Attend various meetups, conferences, and other events that developers attend to promote and sell FusionAuth
* Work directly with the FusionAuth marketing and engineering teams to build sales campaigns that target developers

### Requirements
