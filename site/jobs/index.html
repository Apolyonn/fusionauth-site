        <h3>We are bandwidth-constrained</h3>
        <p>
          Our business has grown much faster than our company. When prioritizing features, those that end up “below the line” are dropped from near term plans due to lack of people to staff them. We have set a high bar for the quality of what we create and how we support our clients. We are not prepared to sacrifice that for quantity of output.
