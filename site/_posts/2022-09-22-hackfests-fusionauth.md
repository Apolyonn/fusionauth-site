Hackfests, also called hackathons or fedex days (because you "ship in a day") are a great way to build team cohesion, explore new technologies and processes, and have a good time. FusionAuth has been doing hackfests for a few years now, and I wanted to write out the what, why and how.

## What is a hackfest?

Having spun up hackfests at three different companies, I have a firm idea of what they consist of. There are a few ground rules:

* everyone should participate
* you should clear people's schedules as best as you can
* it happens during a fixed time
* there's a clear schedule

As far as what people can do, there are two and only two rules:

* no scutwork. This is not a day to catch up on busywork.
* You have to present what you worked on at the end of the day to the entire hackfest audience. This typically includes your boss.

I find the second rule is a nice forcing function for the first. Most people don't want to tell their bosses they spent the entire day answering emails.

However, it makes sense to address two common concerns. How will we make time for this? And can non-technical folks particpate?

Let's take these one at a time.

If you think hackfests are important, you can make time. Be flexible. At one place I worked at, the hackfest started a bit later because the customer service folks came in and plowed through all the tickets they could for a few hours. Then they set up their vacation response. The same strategy can be used with a sales team.

A hackfest is similar to vacation. You always feel a bit behind when you take vacation, but the change of sceneary and the perspective make it valuable for your work productivity. (To say nothing of the fact that vacation makes life more enjohyable and that you shoulnt' view everything through the lens of "will it make me productive".)

Scheduling is also important. Make sure you pick a time weeks in advance at a minimum; don't spring it on anyone. Stay away from deadlines, including the end of the quarter. Be flexible if there are fires to be put out. And if someone can't make it, they can't. They can still attend the presentation. 

In short, you can make time if you think it valuable. More on why it is valuable in the next section.

Let me talk to the second question: if you are trying to involve the entire company, as we do at FusionAuth, what on earth do sales, marketing and other non-technical folks do? Isn't the entire point of a hackfest that there's code delivered at the end?

I've done sales and marketing and folks in those spheres absolutely can participate in a hackfest. It is all about setting expectations for work product. You'll notice that I didn't say "present your code" as the end product above, but rather "present what you've been working on". That can take a lot of different forms:

* Documents
* Mockups
* Reports
* Presentations
* Demos of a tool

Like any other discipline, sales and marketing have tools, processes and strategies that can be examined and improved.

Here's a short sample of possible projects for a sales or marketing team member:

* Trialing a new sales tool, whether independent or a part of your current CRM you haven't fully explored.
* Refining a rough sales process to make it smoother
* Reviewing competitor's (or multiple competitor's) messaging/website/tool to see how your solution compares
* Kicking the tires on a new marketing channel. Been wondering about how to advertise on LinkedIn? Podcasts? Outreach to influencers?
* Building a plan to enter an entirely new market. "How can we sell into India, the government, or to telcos?"
* Reading and summarizing reports about the auth industry and its future technical or social direction.

All of these feel like "hacking" to me; they're about problem solving, thinking out of the box and stepping out of the grind for a bit.

And that's the main purpose of a hackfest.

## Why run a hackfest?

Stepping out of the grind is a key attraction for hackfests for me. Having a dedicated day gives people permisison. This applies to executive, senior and junior employees. Executive and senior employees tend to be super busy, so a day where they can "follow their nose" and explore is rare. Frankly, a free hour can be rare some weeks.

Junior folks, on the other hand, benefit less from the time and more from the permission. They see the business with fresher eyes and often bring perspective of more recent tools and ediucation. But they may feel constrained by the tickets, tasks and other guidance that is provided. A free day means autonomy, as well as stretching in new directions with skills, such as presenting to their boss.

But there are other benefits too

collab
new skills
fun
efficiencies
education

## How do you do this?

email stuff

examples

what about pressure to talk/deliver
