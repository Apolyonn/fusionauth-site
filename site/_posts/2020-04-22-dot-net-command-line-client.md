In this post, we'll build a command line client application for FusionAuth with C# and the .NET core libraries. We'll set up FusionAuth and then add a user to an application from the command line interface (cli) too.

<!--more-->

At the end of this tutorial, you will have a working .NET core application which will allow you to add users one at a time to your FusionAuth user database. 

This might be a useful tool if you had customer service folks comfortable with the CLI that were adding users or other information to a FusionAuth identity server.

In a later tutorial we will use the Authorization Code grant to protect pages in an ASP.NET web application. But for now we'll only be adding users. 

## Prerequisites

We'll be using the following software versions:
- .NET core 3.1.201
- FusionAuth 1.15.5

You need to have the following software installed before you begin:
- Docker (optional, but preferred for installing FusionAuth)

You'll also want to double check to make sure your system meets the [memory, storage and CPU requirements](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements) for FusionAuth.

## Architecture

This application has two main components. 

The first is the .NET core cli tool. This will accept a few arguments and call the FusionAuth APIs to create a user. After doing this, you will be able to see the user in the FusionAuth UI.

And then there is the FusionAuth and identity server, which is a standalone application accessible at `http://localhost:9011`. This will be accessed by you, during configuration and via API calls.

## APIs and client libraries

FusionAuth has a [full featured and well documented API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/) which allows you do create and manage users, applications, and groups. Using this API allows you to extend FusionAuth for purposes never contemplated by the FusionAuth team. You can also integrate it with other data sources and pieces of software that are unknown to us. If your software can speak JSON and reach FusionAuth over a network connection, you can integrate the two.

However, we realize that not everyone wants to write raw JSON. (Wimps.) This is why we have created [client libraries](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/) to make using the API a snap. These are all available under the Apache 2.0 license, so can be embedded in your applications as you see fit.

In this application, I'll be using the [.NET Core client library](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/netcore).

## Setting up FusionAuth

FusionAuth will be our identity server for this tutorial. All user data will be persisted there. Using a central identity server such as FusionAuth means we can manage users across any number of custom or off the shelf applications in one place.

If you don't already have FusionAuth installed, we recommend the Docker Compose option for the quickest setup:

```shell
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
```

Now FusionAuth should be running at http://localhost:9011.

Check out the [Download FusionAuth page](https://fusionauth.io/download) for other installation options (rpm, deb, etc) if you don't have Docker installed.

Sign in as a FusionAuth administrator and create a new application. I creatively named mine 'dotnetcore', and will refer to this application throughout the tutorial. No need to tweak any defaults, but do note the "Id", which we'll use later. Mine is `b1981847-0609-44ba-a377-989966f6e704`.

TBD Image of creating the dotnetcore application.

Then go to the APIs section. We'll need to create an API key for our cli tool. Go to Settings and then "API Keys" in the UI. Create a new key, and set the permissions. Following the principle of least privilege, we'll allow POSTs to `/api/user` and `/api/user/registration` and nothing else. 

Note the key value (it looks something like `J9NXRWmkLVqt2hLc670s-i5iWzdPpgT_uXLuJcnMaFO`), we'll need it later.

## Write the command line client

This cli client will take a user's email, password and favorite color values and create a user in FusionAuth.

The full source code is [available](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-dotnetcore-example). You can just download it and skip ahead to 'Running the command line client' if you'd like. I won't mind.

### Set up the project

Set up a .NET core console project like so:

```
dotnet new console --output usermanager
```

Then go into that directory: 

```
cd usermanager
```

We're going to import a few NuGet packages we'll need:

```
dotnet add package JSON.Net # for debugging
dotnet add package FusionAuth.Client # for our client access
```

Now we write the program. Here's the full listing. 

```
using System;
using io.fusionauth;
using io.fusionauth.domain;
using io.fusionauth.domain.api;
using io.fusionauth.domain.api.user;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace usermanager
{
    class Program
    {
        private static readonly string apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("fusionauth_api_key");
        private static readonly string fusionauthURL = "http://localhost:9011";

	private static readonly string tenantId = "66636432-3932-3836-6630-656464383862";
	private static readonly string applicationId = "4243b56f-0b45-4882-aa23-ac75eea22d22";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
	    if (args.Length != 3) {
                Console.WriteLine("Please provide email, password and favorite color.");
		Environment.Exit(1);
	    }
            string email= args[0];
            string password = args[1];
            string favoriteColor = args[2];

            FusionAuthSyncClient client = new FusionAuthSyncClient(apiKey, fusionauthURL, tenantId);

	    var userRequest = buildUserRequest(email, password, favoriteColor);
            var response = client.CreateUser(null, userRequest);
	    // debugging
	    //string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response);
            //Console.WriteLine(json);

            if (response.WasSuccessful())
            {
                var user = response.successResponse.user;
		var registrationResponse = register(client, user);
		if (registrationResponse.WasSuccessful()) {
                    Console.WriteLine("created user with email: "+user.email);
		} 
                else if (registrationResponse.statusCode != 200) 
                {
                    var statusCode = registrationResponse.statusCode;
                    Console.WriteLine("failed with status "+statusCode);
	            string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response);
                    Console.WriteLine(json);
                } 
            } 
            else if (response.statusCode != 200) 
            {
                var statusCode = response.statusCode;
                Console.WriteLine("failed with status "+statusCode);
	        string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response);
                Console.WriteLine(json);
            } 
        }

        static UserRequest buildUserRequest(string email, string password, string favoriteColor)
	{
	    User userToCreate = new User();
	    userToCreate.email = email;
	    userToCreate.password = password;
	    Dictionary<string, object> data = new Dictionary<string, object>();
	    data.Add("favoriteColor", favoriteColor);
	    userToCreate.data = data;

	    UserRequest userRequest = new UserRequest();
	    userRequest.sendSetPasswordEmail = false;
	    userRequest.user = userToCreate;
	    return userRequest;
	}

        static ClientResponse<RegistrationResponse> register(FusionAuthSyncClient client, User user)
        {
	    RegistrationRequest registrationRequest = new RegistrationRequest();
	    UserRegistration registration = new UserRegistration();
	    registration.applicationId = Guid.Parse(applicationId);
	    registrationRequest.sendSetPasswordEmail = false;
	    registrationRequest.skipRegistrationVerification = true;
	    registrationRequest.skipVerification = true;
	    registrationRequest.registration = registration;
            return client.Register(user.id, registrationRequest);
        }
    }
}

``` 

I'm not going to go over every line, but will highlight a few interesting pieces.

These are configuration values. We hardcode some of these, but the API key we pull from the environment (checking in API keys being a big no-no). Make sure you update these to point to the correct FusionAuth URL and the application you created. The `tenantId` is optional unless you have more than one tenant, but it's good practice to pass it along.
```
...
        private static readonly string apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("fusionauth_api_key");
        private static readonly string fusionauthURL = "http://localhost:9011";

	private static readonly string tenantId = "66636432-3932-3836-6630-656464383862";
	private static readonly string applicationId = "4243b56f-0b45-4882-aa23-ac75eea22d22";
...
```


We build the user object first. This contains basic user information. The password will encrypted using the tenant default encryption settings.

```
...
	    var userRequest = buildUserRequest(email, password, favoriteColor);
            var response = client.CreateUser(null, userRequest);
...
```

If we successfully create the user, we'll then create the registration. Otherwise we punt and complain to the person running the client.

```
...
            if (response.WasSuccessful())
            {
                var user = response.successResponse.user;
		var registrationResponse = register(client, user);
		if (registrationResponse.WasSuccessful()) {
                    Console.WriteLine("created user with email: "+user.email);
		} 
...
            }
...
```

We can store arbitrary key value pairs in the data field.

```
...
	    Dictionary<string, object> data = new Dictionary<string, object>();
	    data.Add("favoriteColor", favoriteColor);
	    userToCreate.data = data;
...
```

A bit more about the registration. The registration field is what ties the user to the application. [Applications](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications) are simply something a user can login to. Each user can be associated with zero to many applications. See [this forum post for more information](https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/topic/5/can-you-limit-a-user-s-login-authentication-access-to-applications-within-a-single-tenant). 

```
...
        static ClientResponse<RegistrationResponse> register(FusionAuthSyncClient client, User user)
        {
	    RegistrationRequest registrationRequest = new RegistrationRequest();
	    UserRegistration registration = new UserRegistration();
	    registration.applicationId = Guid.Parse(applicationId);
	    registrationRequest.sendSetPasswordEmail = false;
	    registrationRequest.skipRegistrationVerification = true;
	    registrationRequest.skipVerification = true;
	    registrationRequest.registration = registration;
            return client.Register(user.id, registrationRequest);
        }
...
```

A note about the API choice. We used the "Create a User" API in this post. This API works well for creating one user at a time; this is what a user onboarding tool might use. However, if you want to import a large number of users into FusionAuth, you'll want to explore the [Bulk Import API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#import-users). Actually, you can do one better and just read the ["Migrate Users" tutorial](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/migrate-users) which will walk you through how to, well, migrate to FusionAuth.

## Running the command line client

To run the client:

```
fusionauth_api_key=<api key> dotnet.exe run -- <email> <password> <favorite color>
```

For example:

```
$ fusionauth_api_key=APIKEY dotnet.exe run --  newuser2@example.com 123pass123 blue
created user with email: newuser2@example.com
```

If you try to create the same user again, you'll receive an error message:

```
$ fusionauth_api_key=APIKEY dotnet.exe run --  newuser2@example.com 123pass123 blue
failed with status 400
{"statusCode":400,"errorResponse":{"fieldErrors":{"user.email":[{"code":"[duplicate]user.email","message":"A User with email = [newuser2@example.com] already exists."}]}}}
```

If you look at the "Users" section of the FusionAuth UI, you will see "newuser2@example.com". If you view the user, they are registered in the "dotnetcore" application.

Image of user TBD

If you want to build an executable to distribute to any user or server with the .NET core runtime available, just run `dotnet build` and you'll see `usermanager.exe` at `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/usermanager.exe`.

## Conclusion

APIs are great, client libraries are even better. Even though the team at FusionAuth is good, they haven't anticipated all of your user management needs. That's why they've built out over ten client libraries that are available in the most popular languages.
