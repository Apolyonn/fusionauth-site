WebAuthn is a revolutionary new way for people to authenticate themselves. It's a widely supported standard years in the making, and all all major browsers work with it. This makes it easy for developers to incorporate it into their website. WebAuthn allows users to leverage the power of biometric, device and other types of authentication via a simple, consistent, browser-native user experience.

## What is WebAuthn?

WebAuthn is another way for users to authenticate online. It is a different type of credentials than the typical username/email and password. It requires something called an "authenticator".

The most important thing about WebAuthn is that it removes the need for a system to store a hashed password. Instead, the system stores a public key. The corresponding private key is held securely by the authenticator.

The types of asymmetric keys that this keypair supports, how the public key is distributed to the system, and how the public/private keypair is used to authenticate a user is all specified by the WebAuthn standard.
