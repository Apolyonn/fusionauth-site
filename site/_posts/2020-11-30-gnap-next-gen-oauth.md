The Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol, also known as GNAP, is currently being formulated in an IETF working group. This protocol will not be backward compatible with OAuth 2. However, since it is a new major auth standard and is currently in development, you should give it some attention.

<!--more-->

GNAP in the discussion stage, but you can read the [draft I'm writing about here](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-02.html). According to the [working group charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/about/), this standard will be released in multiple parts beginning in the middle of 2021. Additionally, they clearly state that GNAP will be backwards compatible with OAuth2 and OIDC, but it is going to solve similar problems:

> This group is chartered to develop a fine-grained delegation protocol for authorization, API access, user identifiers, and identity assertions. ... Although the artifacts for this work are not intended or expected to be backwards-compatible with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, the group will attempt to simplify migrating from OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to the new protocol where possible.

## What's in a name?

Despite the title of this post, the authors of the specification don't call the standard "next gen OAuth". That's how I refer to it. 

The names for this proposed standard are confusing. Others have called it OAuth3. The standard grew out of two competing efforts, called TxAuth and OAuth.xyz. 

However, the specification is properly termed the Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol, or GNAP. GNAP, for those who are wondering, should be pronounced 'g-nap', though there was [some discussion](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/txauth/91n-mXRW_hQWMl-0cGx1j6sxHHI/) on the mailing list about the topic.

## What's wrong with OAuth

Why might you care, if you are happy using OAuth2 and OIDC for your standards based authentication needs? The core OAuth specification, good old [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), was released in 2012 and has some real strengths:

* The spec is widely supported and deployed.
* It can be, and has been, extended to support novel use cases, such as the device grant.
* By leveraging the work of the experts who wrote the RFC as well as commercial and open source tools, you can build a complicated, secure auth system without a security PhD.
* OAuth2 is far easier for clients to implement than other protocols solving similar problems, such as SAML.

But nothing is perfect. OAuth2 also has some flaws, including:

* The tight coupling of the auth process to redirects and a browser as the client.
* Archaic developer ergonomics, including the use of form parameters.
* There are several ways to limit tokens to the clients which requested them ([DPOP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop-02) and [MTLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8705) are options; this is also known as "Proof of possession"), but these solutions are not widely deployed. Most OAuth systems issue bearer tokens, with the concomitant security risks. 
* Discovery of OAuth endpoints is cumbersome. From the RFC: "The means through which the client obtains the location of the authorization endpoint are beyond the scope of this specification, but the location is typically provided in the service documentation." Translation: developer, look it up. There is an [RFC to help with this](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414), though.
* The mobile app experience for OAuth2 is suboptimal. The Security Best Current Practices document for mobile apps, [RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252), indicates that webviews should not be used: "This best current practice requires that native apps MUST NOT use embedded user-agents to perform authorization requests...". This means that your beautiful native app has to open a system browser when it comes time to authenticate. Not the best user experience.

A big issue with OAuth2 is complexity. Here are some of the RFCs that you may need to read as a user of OAuth:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img//blogs/gnap-oauth2-next-gen/oauth2-spec-pyramid.svg" alt="The pyramid of OAuth2 specifications" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

To be fair, [OAuth 2.1 is addressing some of these issues](/learn/expert-advice/oauth/differences-between-oauth-2-oauth-2-1/), but from my research, including reading the draft spec and reviewing discussion on the mailing list, GNAP aims to address them more fully.

WIP

## Things that excite me about GNAP

First, it's worth reiterating that GNAP is changing rapidly. There's a lot of discussion on the [mailing list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/txauth/) and you can also see changes happening in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/). It appears that the draft is being edited there. All that is to say that these features may be in, out, or modified if you read this post months after it was posted.

Here's a video explaining more about GNAP. Plus beer gardens!

{% include _youtube-video.liquid youtubeid="n8xAFjzJsTU" %}

Here are some of the parts of GNAP which seem exciting and will help make auth easier to use going forward.

### Distinct roles for the Requesting Party and Resource Owner 

Right now, the resource owner, who can grant delegate access to the protected resources, is assumed to be the person who requested the grant. This is often the case, as when I grant a photo printing service access to my Flickr account. Wait, is it 2012? I meant my Google Photos account. But sometimes the entity requesting permission may be different than the entity which needs to grant permission, the "Resource Owner" or RO. This is called the "Requesting Party" and has the acronym RQ, maybe because RP already is taken by "Relying Party". The RQ drives the "Resource Client", or RC, which could be a browser or some other device.

From the specification:

> The RQ interacts with the RC to indicate a need for resources on behalf of the RO. This could identify the RS the RC needs to call, the resources needed, or the RO that is needed to approve the request. Note that the RO and RQ are often the same entity in practice.

### Multiple access tokens

A client can ask multiple access tokens in one grant request. This would allow you to ask for different levels of access for different resources. This is of course possible now with multiple grant requests, but could be useful in helping clients follow security best practices such as the principle of least privilege.

Here's an example of how that might look, pulled from the draft specification.

```json
{ 
  "resources": {
    "token1": [
      {
        "type": "photo-api",
        "actions": [
          "read",
          "write",
          "dolphin"
        ],
        "locations": [
          "https://server.example.net/",
          "https://resource.local/other"
        ],
        "datatypes": [
          "metadata",
          "images"
        ]
      },
      "dolphin-metadata"
    ],
    "token2": [
      {
        "type": "walrus-access",
        "actions": [
          "foo",
          "bar"
        ],
        "locations": [
          "https://resource.other/"
        ],
        "datatypes": [
          "data",
          "pictures",
          "walrus whiskers"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see that the resource requests can be rich JSON objects, such as the `photo-api` resource. They can also be simple strings, as is `dolphin-metadata`.

### Interactions are first class concepts

In GNAP, the client, also known as the RC, declares what kind of interactions it supports. The authorization server, also known as the AS, responds with the type of interaction that it wants the client to use to interact with the resource owner, or RO. This is a great way to provide an extension point for the future, while still supporting older clients.

Some examples of interactions include:

* Redirect: "redirect[ing] to an arbitrary URL"
* App: "launch an application URL"
* Callback: a URL provided by the RC after the AS interaction is finished.
* User code: a short code which can be displayed, similar to the device grant.

There's even support for avoiding interaction between the RC and the RO, which is useful if you have an out of band method for the RC and the RO to communicate.

### Continuation of grant

Grant requests in OAuth2 are typically one and done. If circumstances change, you start a new grant. With GNAP, you get a grant identifier if the authorization server determines that the grant can be continued. That might look something like this:

```json
{
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU",
      "key": true
    },
    "uri": "https://server.example.com/continue",
    "wait": 60
  }
}
```

This lets a client step up or step down access. For example, when a client first interacts with a resource, it might need write access, but later only need read access. With GNAP, if the grant can be continued, the client can revise the grant request to get a token tied to fewer privileges. This again helps ensure that the client only has access that it needs, while doing so in a way that isn't an undue burden on the client. 

In some cases, such as the step down scenario above, the authorization server may not even need to communicate with the resource owner. From the spec:

> ... The RC realizes that it no longer needs "write" access and therefore modifies its ongoing request, here asking for just "read" access instead of both "read" and "write" as before. The AS replaces the previous resources from the first request, allowing the AS to determine if any previously-granted consent already applies. In this case, the AS would likely determine that reducing the breadth of the requested access means that new access tokens can be issued to the RC. The AS would likely revoke previously-issued access tokens that had the greater access rights associated with them.

You can also cancel grants, if the client's needs change. This is done with a call that feels RESTFUL:

> If the RC wishes to cancel an ongoing grant request, it makes an HTTP DELETE request to the continuation URI.

### Keys keys everywhere

Cryptographic keys are built deep into GNAP, and are referenced many times in many parts of grants. Here's an example partial request, again pulled from the draft spec, from a client to which an authorization server might respond:

```json
{
    "client": {
      "display": {
        "name": "My Client Display Name",
        "uri": "https://example.net/client"
      },
      "key": {
        "proof": "jwsd",
        "jwk": {
                    "kty": "RSA",
                    "e": "AQAB",
                    "kid": "xyz-1",
                    "alg": "RS256",
                    "n": "kOB5rR4Jv0GMeL...."
        }
      }
    },
}
```

The `key` value of the `client` object is the public key of the client, in this request JSON. This will be bound to requests, and many [formats are supported](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-02.html#name-binding-keys). In some cases, this could also have the value `true`, in which case the token in that response is bound to the key of the cliennt. Bearer tokens still work, however. They didn't abandon that construct, which has been so successful in the OAuth2 ecosystem; in that case the `key` value is `false.

> If the key value is the boolean false, the access token is a bearer token sent using the HTTP Header method defined in [RFC6750].

### Identity built in

Unlike OAuth which is an authorization framework and didn't really have the concept of identity, GNAP has identity built in. The client may request information about the resource owner in the initial grant request. If the authorization server determines that the resource owner has granted permission to release this information to the client, either actively or passively, it can be returned. Here's an example from the draft specification:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "sub_ids": [ {
      "subject_type": "email",
      "email": "user@example.com"
    } ],
    "assertions": {
      "id_token": "eyj..."
    }
  }
}
```

The flip side is also true. If the client knows who the resource owner is, it can present identity claims as well. If a client presents identity claims that the authorization server trusts are tied to the resource owner, the resource owner may not need to be consulted for delegation decisions. From the specification:

> If the AS trusts the RC to present verifiable assertions, the AS MAY decide, based on its policy, to skip interaction with the RO, even if the RC provides one or more interaction modes in its request.

### Developer ergonomics

OAuth requires you to use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type, and all of the interactions are built using form parameters. This is a stable format, guaranteed to be understandable and usable by many different clients. However, many modern APIs use `application/json` as the media format. JSON has its flaws; why oh why can't we have comments in JSON? But this format is more flexible and allows for conveying richer object structures. One nice thing about JSON is that you can collapse many objects into simple strings; you don't have to use nested structures if you don't want to.

You can reference resources, interactions and other entities by reference as well. For example, here's a reference to an interaction which can be used to modify an existing grant, as discussed above:

```json
{
  "interact_ref": "4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1"
}
```

These references are one time use. Additionally, there is one endpoint starting off interaction. In true HATEOAS fashion, clients can start from one well known endpoint and then follow links presented by the authorization server. No more consulting documentation to find out which endpoints you have to call when.

## What should you do?

That's a lot of new functionality. What should you do about GNAP in general?

First, If OAuth2 works for you, keep using it. Use it properly, with all the security suggestions outlined by by OAuth 2.1, including the PKCE extension. Twitter recently updated from 2010's OAuth1; it's likely that systems will still be running OAuth2 in three years. In fact, my team mates laughed when I said three years; they think it'll be more like a decade.

If you are an authorization server vendor, or you build your own OAuth servers, then you should:

* Keep an eye on the draft. There's a lot more in there that is worth examining, and it's changing fast.
* Join the mailing list and contribute if you can, as many members of the identity community already have. I've seen new members join the mailing list and be welcomed with their feedback.
* Watch for or implement reference implementations. Justin, one of the editors of the spec, has committed to transitioning [OAuth.XYZ](https://oauth.xyz/) to being an implementation of GNAP: "GNAP will one day be a formal standard, and as that standardization process takes place, XYZ will transition to being an implementation of that standard. "

If you are a user of OAuth, you can take a more relaxed position. Howeer, it still behooves you to review GNAP and see if it fits your use cases better, especially as the specification becomes more and more concrete. In particular, review the migration path for the major OAuth grants. Have a discussion with your authorization server vendor, or with the maintainers of open source libraries you might use, to see what their plans are for GNAP.
