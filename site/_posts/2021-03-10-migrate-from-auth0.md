Pssst. You may have heard that [Auth0 was recently acquired by Okta](https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-auth0/). If this has you considering migration options, read on. This post will provide a strategy for determining if a migration makes sense.

I'll be using FusionAuth as an example migration alternative, but the investigation and feature mapping can be used to prepare a move to any Auth0 competitor. That said, since the announcement, our website has seen significantly more traffic and we've had dozens of people reach out to learn more about FusionAuth.

## FusionAuth vs Auth0

FusionAuth and Auth0 have many similarities. Both have friendly pricing structures, especially when you have less complex needs. Both allow you to get started quickly. 

Both Auth0 and FusionAuth wrap the complexity of modern authentication, whether social sign-on, SAML, or OIDC, in a complete, easy to use package. Each make it easy to migrate data into their systems.

But the similarities run deeper than that. Both Auth0 and FusionAuth were built with developers in mind. This means great APIs and documentation as well as support for open source projects like example applications. Both have good customer service, with active forums and responsive customer support teams.

However, Auth0 and FusionAuth have differences too. Here are some of the things that FusionAuth offers that Auth0 does not:

* Fully customizable UI
* A robuse consent data model
* Support for parent/child relationships in the auth system
* Flexible password hashing/bring your own algorithm
* Better legacy backend support
* Advanced registration forms
* Unlimited SAML/OIDC connections
* The ability to self-host
* Unlimited tenants
* A truly free option with no limits on the number of users when you self host the community edition

Regardless of FusionAuth's strengths, a migration is a good time to re-evaluate your current system and alternatives. At FusionAuth, we recommend looking at your current Auth0 system and the alternatives both broadly and deeply.

## Broad evaluation

An authentication system is a critical part of your infrastructure. Just like a database, you want to make sure you can trust the software. If there's a commercial vendor behind it, make sure you can trust it as well. 

One alternative we hear about is coding up and running your own auth system. This is definitely an option, but should be weighed against the opportunity cost. Again, consider the database analogy. Should you build your own relational database? I'm sure there are situations where it makes sense, but 99% of the time using an existing solution is better. 

Joe Stech, in ["Why outsource your auth system?"](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/20/why-outsource-auth/), wrote:

> Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance â€“ you don't want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don't want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.

Switching your auth provider is similar to migrating from any other vendor in a lot of ways. However, there are some auth specific considerations that are worth thinking about. Below is some vendor agnostic information about some of these considerations:

* Learn about different tenancy models: ["Multi-Tenant vs. Single-Tenant IDaaS Solutions"](/learn/expert-advice/identity-basics/multi-tenancy-vs-single-tenant-idaas-solutions/)
* Due diligence to perform on any auth vendor: ["Performing Due Diligence on Authentication Vendors"](/learn/expert-advice/identity-basics/due-diligence-authentication-vendors/)
* A list of the challenges of customer identity and access management: ["Challenges of CIAM"](/learn/expert-advice/ciam/challenges-of-ciam/)
* Don't forget perspectives outside of engineering: ["Outsourcing auth: how to get buy-in from your team"](/blog/2021/02/03/outsourced-auth-team-buy-in/)
* Auth system scalability challenges: ["Making Sure Your Auth System Can Scale"](/learn/expert-advice/identity-basics/making-sure-your-auth-system-scales/)

In addition, there are a number of different dimensions on which you could evaluate a system providing authentication, authorization and user management:

* Self hosted or SaaS
* Standalone application or library/framework you integrate
* Open source or not
* Standards support
* Authentication, authorization, user management or all three?
* Single sign-on (SSO) support
* Integrations with other auth tech (such as LDAP)
* Which OAuth grants are supported
* Cost, both initial outlay and forecasted
* Operational complexity
* Support for your deployment environment
* Specific features and customizability
* Documentation and developer experience

I don't know your use cases, so I can't give you specific advice, but [here's a list of auth system providers](https://solutionsreview.com/identity-management/the-30-best-identity-management-companies/) to kickstart your evaluation. 

I'm a big fan of feature matrices, where you determine your requirements and nice to haves, discuss with the team, do some research and complete a broad survey of options. Performing such a survey has a few possible outcomes:

* Auth0 meets your needs, so you will hang tight. Maybe the acquisition will be smooth. Off to the next meeting.
* You decide to revisit the issue the next time your Auth0 contract is renewed. Make a note in your calendar to allow a few months to evaluate and possibly migrate.
* You determine that there are a few alternatives worth a closer look. Time for a prototype.

## Why you should prototype before deciding

Unfortunately, evaluating an auth system isn't simple. It's like switching a content management system. You want to spend some time playing with alternatives in order to come up with a good migration plan. Auth systems, even those using standards such as OAuth, OIDC and SAML, are enmeshed deeply in other systems. This entanglement means that you should build at least a small integration with any auth provider under consideration.

In addition, there are many different ways to use auth systems, as I alluded to above. A solution that works well for a multi-tenant web-based consumer SaaS application where social sign-on is critical may fall short in an on-premise application deployed to Kubernetes within an enterprise customer's environment.

For both of these reasons, it's best to do a proof of concept when you are considering an auth provider. When leaving Auth0 for, say, FusionAuth, you need to map the Auth0 functionality used to the new provider in a running environment. You can [download FusionAuth](/download/) and kick the tires without talking to a sales person. Other providers may require a conversation, but don't move forward without doing a proof of concept. You'll thank me later.

A good rule of thumb is to prototype the riskiest piece of your integrations. Doing so ensures your applications will likely work smoothly with the new provider. Doing this also allows you to get a sense of the responsiveness of support as well as the quality of documentation.

## Evaluating Auth0 functionality

Each part of the Auth0 system used by your applications should be cataloged and compared with the new system. For example, the functionality of permissions, roles and connections may not be the same between Auth0 and any other auth provider. User data, on the other hand, is typically pretty portable. As long as you can migrate a login (a username or email) and a password hash, a user can be successfully moved. 

A partial list of what may need to be migrated for your application or applications to work properly includes the following:

* In Auth0, [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders) are a source of data for users. FusionAuth calls these [Identity Providers](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/).
* [Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules), [Hooks](https://auth0.com/docs/hooks) and [Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/actions) are ways for you to customize authentication or authorization workflows. FusionAuth has a similar concept called [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).
* With Auth0, [APIs, Applications and SSO Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application) are what your users can log in to. They are also called Clients in the Auth0 documentation. FusionAuth refers to these as [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/).
* [Tenants](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/learn-the-basics) are a high level construct which groups other entities such as users and applications together. FusionAuth calls these [Tenants](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants/) as well.
* For Auth0, [Roles and Permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/roles) provide information about what your users can do in your custom or off the shelf applications. FusionAuth has [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles/). They are defined on an Application by Application basis.

One example of a detailed difference that might trip you up, and why a prototype is so important, is that in FusionAuth, users are explicitly mapped to applications with a [Registration](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations/). Auth0 allows users access to all Auth0 applications within a tenant by default. Such details are why there's no substitute for a proof of concept trialling any alternatives you are seriously considering.

However, make sure you have clear goalposts for when a prototype is "good enough". You aren't performing a full fledged migration; you haven't committed to this particular provider. You want to know enough to be able to make an intelligent decision, but there'll always be unexpected hiccups.

### Non-standard functionality

There are other Auth0 features that you'll need to find alternatives for. In other words, you can't just just migrate the configuration discussed above. 

For example, Auth0 provides [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login). This is a complex, configurable login component that works with SPAs, native applications and web applications. FusionAuth's login experience, in contrast, is less complicated. You can choose to [build your own login pages or use FusionAuth's hosted login pages](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points/#login-options). 

Any extensions used from the Auth0 marketplace should be evaluated and equivalent functionality planned for as well.

## Next steps

Oh yeah, the data. You also should plan to export your data. The most important type is usually the aforementioned user data, though your application could use Auth0's connections and not host a single user in the Auth0 managed database. You also want to make sure to move that connection data, to ensure federated users enjoy an uninterrupted login experience.
