In this article, we will discuss the step-by-step process of implementing the OAuth Authorization Code Grant in a Vue.js App. We’ll use FusionAuth as the IdP and also show you how to configure FusionAuth for this workflow.

<!--more-->

At the end, your app will be able to:

- log users in
- log users out
- read user data from FusionAuth
- write user data to FusionAuth

We will use Express for our backend server, which will act as a middleware between our Vue Client and FusionAuth and securely store the Access Token, Client Id, Client Secret, etc.

**Prerequisites**

- Knowledge of Vue and Express concepts.
- Docker (optional, but preferred for installing FusionAuth).
- Node(12.x)/NPM on your local machine.
- Any code editor of your choice.

You’ll also want to make sure your system meets the [memory, storage and CPU requirements](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/system-requirements) for FusionAuth.

If you get stuck at any time, feel free to refer to the finished app's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-vue).

## Setting up FusionAuth

If you don’t already have FusionAuth installed, we recommend Docker Compose option for the quickest setup:

```shell
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
```

Check out the [Download FusionAuth page](/download) for other installation options (rpm, deb, etc) if you don’t have Docker installed. You can further follow the [FusionAuth Installation Guide](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app) for more detailed steps.

Once FusionAuth is running (it listens by default at http://localhost:9011/), create a new application, this tutorial follows an application named `fusionauth-vue-example`. 

Next is to configure our application, there are only two configuration settings that you need to change for this tutorial. In your application's **OAuth** tab:

- Set `Authorized redirect URLs` to `http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback`. This is the Express server URL that will handle processing the FusionAuth callback after a user signs in.
- Set `Logout URL` to  `http://localhost:8081`. This is the URL where the FusionAuth server will redirect us after logout; this is the URL where the Vue app lives. It makes sense that after logout you end up being on the main landing page of the application.

Click **Save**.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/application-configuration.png" alt="OAuth settings for the new application." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Now, we will add our user to the new application. Select **Users** on the dashboard, select **Manage** and go to the **Registration** tab. Then click `Add Registration`, and add yourself to the application you just created.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/user-configuration.png" alt="User settings for the new application." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Finally, navigate to **Settings** and then **API Keys**. You should have an API key present, but feel free to create one. For this tutorial, we won't limit permissions, but you should for production use. Record that value for later.

We won't cover this here, but you can create multiple applications and configure multi-tenant in FusionAuth, which would be useful if you wanted different levels of separation.

And it's done. We can now start working on our initial Vue app. 

## Project Structure

Here is what this project directory looks like:

```
fusionauth-example-vue
├─client
└─server
```

All the express or server-side code will be in the `server` folder, and our Vue app will reside
 in the `client` folder. You don’t need to create folders right now, we will be doing so in the next steps.

## Creating the Vue app

We will use the official Vue CLI to initialize our project which is the best way to scaffold Single Page Applications. It provides batteries-included build setups for a modern front-end workflow. It takes only a few minutes to get up and running with hot-reload, lint-on-save, and production-ready builds. You can read more about [the Vue CLI here](https://vuejs.org/).

Before we create our Vue app, I recommend installing the official Vuejs Extension to make debugging and inspection processes easier. You can [download it here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools).

Use the following command to install Vue CLI globally:

```shell
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
$ yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Now, to create a project run the following command inside the project directory:

```shell
$ vue create client
```

You will be prompted to pick a preset. You can choose the **default preset** which comes with a basic **Babel + ESLint** setup or select **Manually select features** to customize the features according to your needs. 

This project will use the default Babel + ESLint setup. You can [learn more about it here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

Once the project is initialized, start the development server by running the following command:

```shell
$ cd client
$ npm run serve 
```

Open a browser up and look at http://localhost:8081/. This is how your app will look:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/default-vue-application.png" alt="The default Vue application screen." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Remove the sample code

Now you need to clean up and remove some of the sample code that the CLI command generated.

> Note that based on the configuration you choose, you might see different project structures, and if you are not sure how to clean them, then just stick to this example.

Delete `components`, `views`, `router`, and  `assets` folders in `src` and then modify your `main.js` file to look like this:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app');
```

Next, modify your `App.vue` file to look like this:
```html
<template>
  <div id='app'>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'app',
  components: {
  },
};
</script>

<style>
</style>
```

And you're done with this step. Visiting http://localhost:8081/ will show you a blank screen now.

> FUN FACT: You can load environment variables in most SPA (Single Page Applications) templates like Vue, React, etc. without installing any extra dependencies. A minor difference for Vue is that you must add `VUE_APP_` in front of every environment variable. You can read more about this here - [Modes and Environment Variables](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#environment-variables).

Let's set aside the client for a bit, and focus on the server side.

## Express

We will use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as our backend server. It is a super popular library that is widely used by developers.

> FUN FACT: The letter **E**  in stacks like **MERN**, **MEVN**, or **MEAN** stands for Express. 

Inside our root directory, we will create another folder named `server` and initialize a NodeJS application in it. Run the following command in your root directory:

```shell
$ mkdir server
$ cd server
$ npm init -y
$ npm install express cors morgan nodemon dotenv axios express-session query-string
```

We installed a lot of packages, so let’s examine them:

- [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) - middleware that helps us to make cross-origin requests.
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js, you can use this for production.
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - restarting server every time we make a change is a hassle, nodemon automatically restarts the node application when file changes are detected.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - loads environment variables from an `.env` file. We will use this to secure our API key, Client Secret, Client Id, etc.
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - to make HTTP requests.
[](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)- [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) - to store our access token securely.
- [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) -  to stringify form data that we send using `axios`.

As we have installed `nodemon`, to use it inside `package.json` add the following scripts:

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
},
...
```

Next, set up your environment variables. Inside the `server` folder create a `.env` file and store all your config (Client Id, Client Secret, SSH keys, or API credentials) inside it. 

```
SERVER_PORT = 9000
FUSIONAUTH_PORT = 9011
CLIENT_ID = 'c8642b18-5d1d-42b4-89fb-a37a5b750186'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'oo06PflPxQrpfxqP8gY9ioOmfzQxARIW5R3BjJrlbS4'
REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback'
APLICATION_ID = 'c8642b18-5d1d-42b4-89fb-a37a5b750186'
API_KEY = 'Dy9bphElA3L3_ayW86T5KvrZkyK1Gj5EDV_2m9i39ow'
```

You might notice that every environment variable is in CAPITAL LETTERS, it’s not a rule, just a convention to separate environment variables from your code variables.

A bit more explanation. `REDIRECT_URI`  is the same as the URL in  `Authorized redirect URLs`.  `APPLICATION_ID` is same as `CLIENT_ID`. You can change `SERVER_PORT` to whatever port you want; this tutorial will use port **9000** for the server.

Now, you may wonder where to get all this other information for `.env` file, just go to the application that you made earlier in the FusionAuth dashboard and click `View` button, the one with the green search button and you can just copy/paste `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`  from there.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/oauth-configuration.png" alt="Client Id and Client Secret settings for the application." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

We have not discussed how to create the `API_KEY`, but [learn more about it here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication) if you want to create your own, otherwise use the one you noted above.

Below is the code for a basic express server; notice that we make use of `dotenv` by adding the following code inside our `index.js`:

```javascript
//...
require("dotenv").config();
//...
```

We can then use environment variables by writing `process.env.` in front of the environment variable's name whenever we use them in our code. 

Since the `.env` file is ignored by git because of the `.gitignore` file, you will notice an `.env.example` file in the source code. To run on your local machine, rename that file to `.env` and add your Client Id, Client Secret, etc.

Here is the sample code for an express server that makes use of all our installed packages:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const morgan = require("morgan");

// dotenv
require("dotenv").config();

const app = express();

// Use our middlewares
app.use(cors({ origin: true, credentials: true }));
app.use(morgan("common"));
app.use(express.json());

// Provide a defualt port 
const port =  process.env.SERVER_PORT || 3000;

// Listen to server  
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
  });
```
      
To access our server from the browser, we will use the `cors` middleware. Remember to use `{ origin: true, credentials: true }` with `app.use(cors())`; you can read more about this [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

Run the following command to start the development server in a new terminal window:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Head over to http://localhost:9000/; you will see an error! That behavior is correct since we have not created any routes yet.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/borked-route.png" alt="The express route doesn't exist yet, so we see an error message." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Right now might be the only time we will run the server; since we have installed `nodemon`, the server will automatically restart every time it detects a file change. 

In your terminal, you can see  `morgan` in action. Whenever a request is made to our server, it will log it in the terminal like this:

```
::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [10/Jul/2020:08:48:21 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 139
```

This can be very useful in debugging an application both in development and in production. 

Now Let's create a simple route for our main page:

```javascript
//...
// Main Page
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send({
   message:"FusionAuth Example With Vue"
  });
});
//...
```

Now you can see a response at http://localhost:9000/

```
{
  "message": "FusionAuth Example With Vue"
}
```

## Sign In

Now, we will start creating the Sign In functionality for our application.

Our Vue application is empty. Let’s first add a heading and a container where we will render different components.

Inside `client/src/App.vue` add the following:
    
```html
<template>
  <div id='app'>
    <header>
      <h1>FusionAuth Example Vue</h1>
    </header>
    <div id = 'container'></div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'app',
  components: {
  },
};
</script>
<style>
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 40px;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
#container{
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  border-radius: 15%;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  margin: auto;
}
</style>
```

CSS will not be discussed in this tutorial; it is up to you to beautify this application with CSS or UI libraries. 

Here is how your app will look like now:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/basic-app-shell.png" alt="The shell of the Vue.js app" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Now, based on whether the user is logged in or not, we will show different messages. For example, a message that says "Welcome, dinesh@fusionauth.io" should only be displayed if the user `dinesh@fusionauth.io` is logged in. 

We will first hard code this response and then modify it to vary according to the response we get from FusionAuth.

Create a new vue file `Greeting.vue` in the `src` folder.  We will create simple logic to check whether a user is logged in or not, which is Conditional Rendering. If `email` is present, the user is considered logged in. You can [read more about this here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html).

```html
<template>
  <div class="greet">
    <h3 v-if="email">Welcome {{email}} </h3>
    <h3 v-else>You are not logged in</h3>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'Greet',
  props: ["email"],
};
</script>
<style > 
*{
  margin-top:30px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
}
</style>
```

You will also notice something weird in the above code, we are using `email` to check whether the user is logged in or not. But where is this `email` value coming from?

The answer is we are passing this `email` as a prop from `App.vue` hence you can see a `prop` field in the `<script>` section. It might not make sense as to why we are doing this now but remember we will have other components in our app which will need the response data that we get from the server. Instead of calling for the same data in each individual component, it will be much better to request it in our central `App.vue` file and then pass the required data as props. 

Next, we need to import this file in our `App.vue` and send the data to `<Greet />` component which we will be done with `v-bind`:

```html
<template>
  <div id='app'>
    <header>
      <h1>FusionAuth Example Vue</h1>
    </header>
    <div id = 'container'>
      <Greet v-bind:email="email" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import Greet from './Greeting';
export default {
  name: 'app',
  components: {
      Greet,
  },
  data(){
    return {
      email : 'dinesh@fusionauth.io'
    }
  }
};
</script>
<style>
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 40px;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
#container{
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 5px solid gray ;
  border-radius: 15%;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  margin: auto;
}
</style>
```
    
Go to http://localhost:8081/; you will see `Welcome dinesh@fusionauth.io`.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/welcome-screen-hardcoded.png" alt="The welcome screen with hardcoded data." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Now comment out `email` in the `App.vue` `data()` call.

```javascript
//...
data(){
  return {
    //email : "dinesh@fusionauth.io"
    }
}
//...
```

Again head over to http://localhost:8081/
As you can see, since we have removed `email`, we are now seeing a not logged in the message.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/welcome-screen-hardcoded-no-email.png" alt="The welcome screen with hardcoded data, but no email." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Great, the client works! We will now implement the same logic based on requests to our server.

## Getting user info from the Express server

We will create a `user` route in our express server to send fake user data to our application. Then, we will replace it with real data based on a request to FusionAuth.

In your `server` folder, create a new folder `routes` and inside that folder create a new file named `user.js`.

```
server
├──node_modules
├──routes
│  └─user.js
├──index.js
├──package.json
└─package-lock.json
``` 

Create  a new `get` route in `user.js`, with this code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
    
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    user: {
      email: 'dinesh@fusionauth.io'
    }
  });
});
module.exports = router;
```

Now to use this route, add following to our `index.js` file:

```javascript
app.use('/user', require('./routes/user'))
```

And it's done, go to http://localhost:9000/user, and you will see the following response.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "dinesh@fusionauth.io"
  }
}
```

Remember, a *real* User object returned from FusionAuth will have more properties than just an email address. It will look something like this:

```json
{
  active: true,
  applicationId: '1ac76336-9dd9-4048-99cb-f998af681d3e',
  aud: '1ac76336-9dd9-4048-99cb-f998af681d3e',
  authenticationType: 'PASSWORD',
  email: 'dinesh@fusionauth.io',
  email_verified: true,
  exp: 1594893748,
  iat: 1594890148,
  iss: 'acme.com',
  roles: [],
  sub: 'abdee025-fa3c-4ce2-b6af-d0931cfb4cea'
}
```

Now inside our `App.vue` file, we will use the `mounted()` lifecycle hook to make a call to our server:

```javascript
//...
mounted() {
  fetch(`http://localhost:9000/user`, {
    credentials: "include" // fetch won't send cookies unless you set credentials
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data=> console.log(data));
}
//...
```

Here is the output of the above code in the console:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "dinesh@fusionauth.io"
  }
}
```

We can now use this object to check if the user is logged in or not. We will need to first define `email` as `null` in `data()`. If a response is received from the server-side, we will update `email` with the received value which in this case is an object with a property of `email`.
    
```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <header>
      <h1>FusionAuth Example Vue</h1>
    </header>
    <div id="container">
      <Greet v-bind:email="email" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import Greet from "./Greeting";
export default {
  name: "app",
  components: {
    Greet
  },
  data() {
    return {
      email: null
    };
  },
  mounted() {
    fetch(`http://localhost:9000/user`, {
      credentials: "include" // fetch won't send cookies unless you set credentials
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => (this.email = data.user.email));
  }
};
</script>
<style>
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 40px;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
#container {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  border-radius: 15%;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  margin: auto;
}
</style>
```

The output of the above is the same as when we have specified `email` in `data()`. 

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/welcome-screen-hardcoded.png" alt="The welcome screen with hardcoded data." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

If we comment `email` in `server/routes/user.js`, we will see a `You are not logged in` message in our application. We can change the email in `server/routes/user.js` and see the corresponding DOM changes as follows:

```
user:{
  email: 'richard@fusionauth.io'
}
```

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/welcome-screen-hardcoded-richard.png" alt="The welcome screen with Richard's hardcoded data." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Sending Data from FusionAuth

We will finally, instead of sending sample data, send actual data from FusionAuth. For this, we will first need to create a `login` route; how can we send user data if there is no user logged in?

Create a new file `server/routes/login.js` and add this `route` to `index.js`.

```
server
├──node_modules
├──routes
│  ├─login.js
│  └─user.js
├──index.js
├──package.json
└─package-lock.json
```

In `index.js`, add the login route:

```javascript
//...
// Routes
app.use('/user', require('./routes/user'))
app.use('/login', require('./routes/login'))
//...
```

Here is the request that is made in `login.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {

  const stateValue = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15) + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2,15);

  req.session.stateValue = stateValue

  res.redirect(`http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${process.env.CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${process.env.REDIRECT_URI}&response_type=code&state=${stateValue}`);
});
module.exports = router;
```

One important thing to notice is the endpoint that where we are making requests to, i.e., `/oauth2/authorize`. This endpoint will provide us with an Authorization Code, which we will discuss in a bit. You can [read more about it here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints#authorize).

Another thing is the `stateValue` or the state parameter, which is generally used as a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token. Any value provided in this field will be returned on a successful redirect, and if it isn't present, the communication may be compromised. We will later use this value in `oauth-callback` route. You can [read more about this here](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

Let’s discuss the other parameters we have used above. `redirect_uri` informs FusionAuth where to redirect the user to after login. `response_type` tells FusionAuth which OAuth flow we’re using (Authorization Code in this example).

Try navigating to http://localhost:9000/login. And if everything is correct, you will see an error. Yes your code is working fine, no need to recheck. You will see an error like this.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/initial-error.png" alt="An error screen on a login attempt" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

If you review `login.js` above, you will find that `REDIRECT_URI` is set to `http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback` in our `.env` file but we haven’t actually created that route yet. So this error makes sense. We're actually logged in because we signed into the FusionAuth Dashboard from our previous configuration. 

If you were using a new browser or an incognito window, you might see the login screen instead:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/default-login-screen.png" alt="The default login screen." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## OAuth Callback

Now, let’s get rid of the error and create a `oauth-callback` route. Inside `routes` create a new file `oauth-callback.js`.

Add this route to `index.js` 

```javascript
//...
// Routes
app.use('/user', require('./routes/user'))
app.use('/login', require('./routes/login'))
app.use('/oauth-callback', require('./routes/oauth-callback'))
//...
```

During redirect, the `/oauth-callback` route will receive an Authorization Code from FusionAuth as a URL parameter. You can see it on the previous error page in the URL bar. It will be something like this (notice the string after `code=`):

```
http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback?code=SSXVv3xkNTKEhnY4XzjUVvRZp7eyhgCuuREAgSeByrw&locale=en&userState=Authenticated
```

This Authorization Code is not sufficient to access user information, for that we will need an `access_token`. To get an `access_token` we will make a post request to `/oauth2/token` endpoint with this Authorization Code.

When we make that request, we will also need to store this `access_token`. We can’t store it in a variable because we need it for future requests. We need a secure way that doesn’t expose this `access_token` and prevents malicious activities.

We will store this `access_token` using the `express-session` middleware, so we need to import `express-session`.

```javascript
//...
const session = require("express-session")
//...
```

And then we need to add the following to `index.js`. It might be worth checking out the [Express Session docs](https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme) for more information.

```javascript
// configure sessions
app.use(session(
  {
    secret: '1234567890', // don't use this secret in prod :)
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      secure: 'auto',
      httpOnly: true,
      maxAge: 3600000
    }
  })
);
```

Now, we can get back to `oauth-callback.js` files and make the post request to receive the `access_token`.

Don’t let the below code confuse you, we will discuss it piece by piece.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const axios = require("axios").default;
const qs = require("query-string");

const config = {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
};
const url = `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/token`;

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
// State from Server
const stateFromServer = req.query.state;
if (stateFromServer !== req.session.stateValue) {
  console.log("State doesn't match. uh-oh.");
  console.log(`Saw: ${stateFromServer}, but expected: &{req.session.stateValue}`);
  res.redirect(302, '/');
  return;
}
  //post request to /token endpoint
  axios
    .post(
      url,
      qs.stringify({
        client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
        code: req.query.code,
        grant_type: "authorization_code",
        redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT_URI,
      }),
      config
    )
    .then((result) => {

      // save token to session
      req.session.token = result.data.access_token;
      console.log(result)
      //redirect to Vue app
     res.redirect(`http://localhost:8081`);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
    });
});
module.exports = router;
```
    
We start with standard code for a route just like `login.js`. And then we import `axios` and `querystring`. 
We then use `if` statement to check the state parameter; if it does not match, we `console.log()` an error message.

We will use `axios` to make post requests to `oauth2/token` endpoint; this is the complete URL that we will request:

```javascript
const url = `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/token`;
```

Another thing you will notice is the config variable. The `oauth2/token` endpoint can only access form-encoded data, which is why we are explicitly setting the content type in the headers.

```javascript
//...
const config = {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
};
//...
```

Now, let’s talk about the body of the request. If you go through the [FusionAuth docs](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints#token), you will find these are standard request parameters that we need to send to the `oauth2/token` endpointi. Some are optional and some are required. The `code` is the Authorization Code that we received from `oauth2/authorize` endpoint and `grant_type` tells FusionAuth we’re using the Authorization Code Flow.


```javascript
//...
qs.stringify({
  client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  code: req.query.code,
  grant_type: "authorization_code",
  redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT_URI,
})
//...
```

The `query-string` library stringifies this request object as you can see below. This saves us from doing this manually and makes code more readable.

```
// the stringified parameters
'client_id=1ac76336-9dd9-4048-99cb-f998af681d3e&client_secret=NLmIgHC65zHeHOPlQMmOMG4Nberle41GT85RUgijdqA&code=e_oTyBn_7WPTPgtFUjvEZk6TwBBLYajRi8NMixQehd0&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9000%2Foauth-callback'
```

After a successful post request, we use `.then()` to access the response from the endpoint. We then store the `access_token` received in the session with the name `req.session.token`. The above code has a `console.log()` of this response so that you can see the response. We are only concerned with the `data` property, though other information is returned. After storing this `access_token` we redirect to our Vue App. Here's an example of what might be returned after a successful login:

```json
data: {
  access_token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjcxNDcxZGE3ZiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiIxYWM3NjMzNi05ZGQ5LTQwNDgtOTljYi1mOTk4YWY2ODFkM2UiLCJleHAiOjE1OTQ4ODkzODAsImlhdCI6MTU5NDg4NTc4MCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiJhYmRlZTAyNS1mYTNjLTRjZTItYjZhZi1kMDkzMWNmYjRjZWEiLCJhdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvblR5cGUiOiJQQVNTV09SRCIsImVtYWlsIjoiYXNodXNpbmdoMTU2NzNAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uSWQiOiIxYWM3NjMzNi05ZGQ5LTQwNDgtOTljYi1mOTk4YWY2ODFkM2UiLCJyb2xlcyI6W119.Dcktd6933XI7iDEsH2RbR49lse-Mamx7B5k1q4hSz_o',
  expires_in: 3599,
  token_type: 'Bearer',
  userId: 'abdee025-fa3c-4ce2-b6af-d0931cfb4cea'
}
```

You can see what an `access_token` looks like. The axios request ends with a catch block to handle any error that we may encounter.

Now, head over to http://localhost:9000/login. if everything goes well, you will end up on your Vue application homepage because that is what we have set in `redirect_uri` and can see the response in the console (the terminal where you are running your server).

## Logout

So, we have a `login` route that the signs in a user and then redirects back to our Vue app. Before we add this `login` route in our Vue app, let’s create a `logout` route and add them together. You will understand why it makes sense to add them together in a bit.

Inside `server/routes` create a new file named `logout.js`.

```
server
├──node_modules
├──routes
│  ├─login.js
│  ├─oauth-callback.js
│  ├─logout.js
│  └─user.js
├──index.js
├──package.json
└─package-lock.json
```

Add then add this route to `index.js`:

```javascript
//...
// Routes
app.use('/user', require('./routes/user'))
app.use('/login', require('./routes/login'))
app.use('/logout', require('./routes/logout'))
app.use('/oauth-callback', require('./routes/oauth-callback'))
//...
```

Inside the `logout.js` file add the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // delete the session
  req.session.destroy();
  // end FusionAuth session
  res.redirect(`http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/logout?client_id=${process.env.CLIENT_ID}`);
});
module.exports = router;
```

Compared to `oauth-callback.js`, it is pretty simple. We first destroy the Express server-side session (and the `token` we store there) and then redirect to `oauth2/logout` endpoint with our Client Id. 

Head over to http://localhost:9000/logout and you will logout from FusionAuth, then head over to http://localhost:9000/login and you will see the login page which on submitting takes you back to your Vue application.

You might wonder why after **logging out** we **redirect back to our Vue app**, yet we didn’t write that in `logout.js`. This is happening because we configured the main entry point to our Vue App as the Logout URL in FusionAuth.

## Retrieving user data

We have been using fake user data up until now. Since we now have `access_token` stored in the session we can use it to request actual user data from FusionAuth.

Modify the `user.js` contents to be:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const axios = require("axios");
const qs = require("querystring");
  
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // token in session -> get user data and send it back to the vue app
  if (req.session.token) {
    axios
      .post(
        `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/introspect`,
        qs.stringify({
          client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
          token: req.session.token,
        })
      )
      .then((result) => {
        let introspectResponse = result.data;
        // valid token -> get more user data and send it back to the Vue app
        if (introspectResponse) {
          
          // GET request to /registration endpoint
          axios
            .get(
              `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/api/user/registration/${introspectResponse.sub}/${process.env.APLICATION_ID}`,
              {
                headers: {
                  Authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
                },
              }
            )
            .then((response) => {
              res.send({
                introspectResponse: introspectResponse,
                body: response.data.registration,
              });
            })
        }
      // expired token -> send nothing 
        else {
          req.session.destroy();
          res.send({});
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
      });
  }
  // no token -> send nothing
  else {
    res.send({});
  }
});
module.exports = router;
```

Let’s discuss this step by step. 

First, we check if an `access_token` is present and then make a **POST** request to `oauth2/introspect` endpoint which requires Client Id and the token. Like the `oauth2/token` endpoint, this endpoint expects form-encoded data, so we are using the `query-string` library.

When this request is successful, we get a response object which contains a `data` property that has the information we need.

Here's an example of the JSON:
```json
{
  active: true,
  applicationId: '9d5119d4-71bb-495c-b762-9f14277c116c',
  aud: '9d5119d4-71bb-495c-b762-9f14277c116c',  
  authenticationType: 'PASSWORD',
  email: 'richard@fusionauth.io',
  email_verified: true,
  exp: 1594904052,
  iat: 1594900452,
  iss: 'acme.com',
  roles: [],
  sub: 'abdee025-fa3c-4ce2-b6af-d0931cfb4cea'   
}
```

Then we make another request to access more user information this time a **GET** request to the `/api/user/registration` API. This API requires the User Id which is the `sub` value of our response from `oauth2/introspect` endpoint. When this request is successful, we send all the data to our client via `res.send()`. Note that this is not standardized, but the response from the `/oauth2/introspect` endpoint is.

Here is what the response from `/api/user/registration` looks like:

```json
{
  "applicationId": "9d5119d4-71bb-495c-b762-9f14277c116c",
  "data": "",
  "id": "c756e203-ea1f-491e-9446-b70ed4eecc17",
  "insertInstant": 1594898302209,
  "lastLoginInstant": 1594900452281,
  "username": "ashu",
  "usernameStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "verified": true
}
```

The API key that we are passing in headers is not part of OAuth standard. You need it to call non-standard endpoints such as the [User Registration API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations#retrieve-a-user-registration). We added this to show how you will use the API Key (in `Authorization` header) if you decide to explore more endpoints which require the API key.

## Showing User Data

We can now access user's information that was stored in FusionAuth. The next step is to display that data. In our `App.vue` we need to modify `mounted()`, since this time we are getting a response object that contains data from two endpoints.

We just need to one line in `App.vue`, instead of `data.user.email`, this time it will be `data.introspectResponse.email`. While we are doing this, let’s define `body` as null in `data()` and store `body` field of the response object inside it. 

```javascript
//...
data() {
  return {
    email: null,
    body: null,
  };
},
mounted() {
  fetch(`http://localhost:9000/user`, {
    credentials: "include" // fetch won't send cookies unless you set credentials
  })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    this.email = data.introspectResponse.email;
    this.body= data.body;
  });
}
//...
```

Everything else remains the same, we are now getting user information from FusionAuth in our application instead of fake user data. 

Go through the login process once again, and you should see "Welcome [your email address]".

## Adding sign in and sign out in Vue

We have previously created the endpoints for `login` and `logout` so let's add them in our Vue application. Create a new file named `Login.vue` and add the following

```html
<template>
  <h1 v-if="email"><a href='http://localhost:9000/logout'>Sign Out</a></h1>
  <h1 v-else><a href='http://localhost:9000/login'>Sign In</a></h1>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: "Login",
  props: ["email"],
};
</script>
```

According to the above code, if the user is not logged in, `Sign In` will be shown, otherwise `Sign Out` will be shown. `email` is passed from `App.vue` as a prop here, so let's do that. In our `App.vue`, first import this file :

```javascript
import Login from "./Login";
```

And then add this to `components`:

```javascript
components: {
  Greet,
  Login 
}
```
 
And finally use it inside the `<template>` tags, passing `email`:

```html
<div id="container">
  <Greet v-bind:email="email" />
  <Login v-bind:email="email" />
</div>
```

Here is how it our application looks like now, we can now login and logout with a click. Here's the application when you are signed out:
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/when-logged-out.png" alt="application when logged out." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

And here's the application when you are signed in (if you signed up with `richard@fusionauth.io`):
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/when-logged-in.png" alt="The application when logged in." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Changing User Info

This last section deals with setting user data from our application.

We will create the `/set-user-data` route; inside `routes` create `set-user-data.js` and add this code to it:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const axios = require("axios");
const qs = require("query-string");
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  // POST request to /introspect endpoint
  axios
    .post(
      `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/oauth2/introspect`,
      qs.stringify({
        client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
        token: req.session.token,
      })
    )
    .then((response) => {
      let introspectResponse = response.data;
    
      // PATCH request to /registration endpoint
      axios.patch(
        `http://localhost:${process.env.FUSIONAUTH_PORT}/api/user/registration/${introspectResponse.sub}/${process.env.APLICATION_ID}`,
        {
          registration: {
            data: req.body,
          },
        },
        {
          headers: {
            Authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
          },
        }
      ).catch(err=>{
          console.log(err)
      })
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(err);
    });

});
module.exports = router;
```

To ensure that we are updating the user currently logged in, we extract the token from our server which is done by making a **POST** request to the `oauth/introspect` endpoint; this is similar to what we did in the `user` route. 

Once this request is successful, we make a **PATCH** request to `/api/user/registration` API. If you go through the [User Registration docs](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations#update-a-user-registration), you will find that this API accepts both **PUT** and **PATCH** requests but here we are using **PATCH** since we only want to update a single part of the resource and **PATCH** will merge the request parameters into the existing object. 

The `data` to send is stored inside the `registration` object which takes it value from `req.body`. This `registration` represents a user's association with an application. The `data` attribute allows us to store arbitrary data related to a user's registration in an application. We will be sending user data from our Vue app to the Express server via JSON in the body of a **POST** HTTP message.

## Setting user data from Vue

Now that we have created our route for updating user data, let’s create a `text-area` in our Vue app. We will type the user data in that, which will be sent to the server when the `Submit` button is clicked.

In `client/src` create a new file named `Update.vue` and add the following to it:

```html
<template>
  <form>
    <textarea
      v-model="userData"
      placeholder="Update FusionAuth user data."
    ></textarea>
    <button type="submit" class="button">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: "Update",
  data() {
    return {
      userData: "",
    };
  },
</script>
<style>
textarea {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
button {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-top: 5px;
}
</style>
```

One of the cool features of Vue is that by using `v-model="userData"` and initializing `userData=""` in the `data()` function, it creates a two-way data binding between `textarea` and `userData`.

We can now access whatever we type in `textarea` in `userData`. You can [read more about it here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html).

Then add this component to `App.vue` . It does not make sense to show this component when the user is not logged in. To hide it, just add `v-if="email"` with this component. Like some of our other components it will check to see if `email` is present or not, i.e., if user is logged in or not.

```html
<Update v-if="email" />
```

We still haven’t configured the `Submit` button. Let's do so to send whatever we type in `textarea` to our server to be stored. For this, we will create a function `update` inside the `methods()` section.

```javascript
//...
methods: {
  update: function() {
    fetch(`http://localhost:9000/set-user-data`, {
      credentials: "include",
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userData: this.userData,
      }),
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
      });
      this.userData=''
  },
},
//...
```

In the above function, we use `fetch()` to **POST** JSON-encoded data. If you are familiar with `fetch()` API, you will see that this is a simple **POST** request using `fetch()`, nothing fancy. You can [read more about it here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

Once we have sent `userData` to our server, we empty the `textarea` using `this.userData=''`, since it is a two-way binding.

And now to bind this function to `submit` event we will add the following to the `form` tag.

```html
<form @submit.prevent="update">
  //
</form>
```

Using `.prevent` stops the page from reloading whenever the Submit button is clicked. Here is how our application looks now:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/oauth-vuejs/signed-in-with-text-area.png" alt="The application when logged in with the text area for updating the data." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Now go to your Vue app and type some message in the `textarea` and click the Submit button. You can now see that message under **User data** in **Users** tab in the FusionAuth dashboard. 

## Conclusion

Congrats, you have built a Vue app that can log in, log out, and modify user data. This article provides a foundation for implementing OAuth using FusionAuth, and there are still so many features, components, and routes that you can add. 

Again, here's [the code](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-vue) that you can fork and look at.

Here are a few ideas of what you can do next:

- [Register Users from the App itself.](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations#create-a-user-and-registration-combined)
- Secure your server using middlewares like [Helmet,](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) 
- Explore third party OAuth like [Google](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/google), [Twitter,](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/twitter) etc.

Check out the [FusionAuth APIs](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/) for even more options.
