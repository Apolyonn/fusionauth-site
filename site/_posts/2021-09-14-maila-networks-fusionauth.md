-------

**Dan:** Can you tell me a bit about Maila Networks? What is the company's mission?

**Jean Rousseau:** We're a Service Provider, offering Data Center Services and Telecommunications offerings in the south of Brazil.

Our mission is to provide the best experience to our customers mixing the service and connectivity offerings, both being delivered with security in mind.


**Dan:** Tell me about your work as CTO at Maila Networks.

**Jean Rousseau:** It's a big responsibility but it comes with a lot of joy. I'm involved in many different areas, going from technical to design, and even being on the field with the technicians to grasp the feeling and understand their needs.

**Dan:** How do you use FusionAuth? OAuth? User management? Social sign-on? Something else?
        
**Jean Rousseau:** We started using for a simple project and replaced the Coovachilli hotspot, nowadays I'm experimenting it in other areas to integrate all sign-on's with just a single application.

**Dan:** What applications are you planning to integrate with FusionAuth?

**Jean Rousseau:** Different wifi hotspot applications and email servers.

**Dan:** What problems did we solve for you? And how were you solving them before FusionAuth?

**Jean Rousseau:** The authentication, logging and searching problems that we had.

**Dan:** What kind of searching do you find FusionAuth to be helpful for? Can you give an example?

**Jean Rousseau:** When we had different servers, we had to go through the logs in different servers. That was time consuming.

**Dan:** How were you solving these problems before FusionAuth?

**Jean Rousseau:** We needed several servers and applications running to get all the data. With FusionAuth everything is concentrated in a single app, with the possibility to add other nodes to share the load.

**Dan:** Why did you choose FusionAuth over the alternatives?

**Jean Rousseau:** The price was the main factor. As the company itself puts it: it's transparent.

**Dan:** How much time and money would you say FusionAuth has saved you?

**Jean Rousseau:** I haven't being able to measure it (yet), but it saved us from having to build our own application.

**Dan:** How long would you estimate it would have taken you to build your own application? 

**Jean Rosseau:** I'm just estimating, but the last time we had to build one it took us around 6 months.

**Dan:** How do you run FusionAuth (Kubernetes, standalone tomcat server, behind a proxy, etc)?
        
**Jean Rousseau:** We're running on a OpenStack cluster and we have a Nginx Server in front of it.

**Dan:** Any general feedback/areas to improve?

**Jean Rousseau:** I would recommend a few additions on the installation tutorial, they're simple things, but we never install some of the packages unless we really need: tar, zip, unzip and curl.
