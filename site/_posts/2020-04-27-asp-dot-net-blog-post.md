Previously, we used .NET Core to [build a command line tool](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/04/28/dot-net-command-line-client) to add users to a FusionAuth instance. In this tutorial, we'll build out a web application which will have a protected page. We'll use Razor Pages and implement both login and logout.

## Configuring FusionAuth

You should already have FusionAuth up and running. If you don't, head over to the post [Creating a user in FusionAuth with a .NET Core CLI Client](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/04/28/dot-net-command-line-client) and download and install FusionAuth. You'll also need to create the application. If you want to skip building the CLI client, you can just create a user in the UI.

We are going to make a few changes to the configuration to allow the web application to work. 

First, we're going to create a new signing key. There's a list of [supported algorithms](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/wiki/Supported-Algorithms) that work with the Identity Model project we're using, but currently [symmetric algorithms are not supported](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.AspNetCore/issues/102) with the open source .NET Core authentication library we are going to use. Using the default HMAC key resulted in an `SecurityTokenSignatureKeyNotFoundException`. FusionAuth supports [different key types](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/keys#generate-a-key), so we can generate an asymmetric key which will work with the library.

To generate the key, go to "Settings" then to "Key Master". In the upper right hand corner, click on the dropdown next to "Import Public Key" and choose "Generate RSA". Use a descriptive name like "For dotnetcore" and leave the rest of defaults alone and click "Submit".

Next, we'll be modifying the 'dotnetcore' application, so go ahead and edit that.  Then go to the OAuth tab. Add an 'Authorized Redirect URL' of `http://localhost:5000/signin-oidc`. Then add a Logout URL of `http://localhost:5000`. The web application we are going to build is going to live there, so we're setting things up so that the Authorization Code grant knows where to send users. 

When you are done, the OAuth tab should look like this:

Next, go to the JWT tab. Enable JSON Web Token signing. 

Change the "Access token signing key" and "Id token signing key" to the previously created key. You can leave rest of the defaults alone. When you are done, the JWT tab should look like this:

Click the blue 'save' icon. We're done configuring FusionAuth.

## Build the ASP.NET Razor Pages application

Now let's start building our ASP.NET Core web application. This application will display some information to all users, but will also have a secured area which will only be available to an authenticated user. Good thing we have already added one. As usual, we have the [full source code](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-asp-net-core) available if you want to download it and take a look.

The first thing to do is create a new web application:

```shell
dotnet new webapp -o SampleApp
cd SampleApp
```

We can publish this application and then run it. There are [other ways of deploying the code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/), but I chose this to make sure my deployment process was repeatable.


This code builds a standalone executable I could deploy behind a proxy like NGINX. You can target Linux and macOS, but in this tutorial I'll be building a standalone Windows 64-bit executable.
```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x64
```

Then I start up the executable:

```shell
bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win-x64/publish/SampleApp.exe
```

I can hit `control-C` to exit out of this application at any time. I also like to open up a separate terminal so that I can make edits to the source files (if you aren't using Visual Studio or another editor). I also like to combine the publish and start up commands into one line (I run this is in a bash shell):

```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 && bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win-x64/publish/SampleApp.exe
```

If I visit `http://localhost:5000` I'm redirected to an https address and get a warning from my browser. While that would make sense in production (unless we terminated TLS before traffic gets to this application), we don't need that behavior in development. Remove `app.UseHttpsRedirection();` from `Startup.cs`.

We'll also want to add a page to be secured. Add `Secure.cshtml` and `Secure.cshtml.cs` to `SampleApp/Pages` with the following content:

```html
@page
@model SecureModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "I'm full of secure data";
}
<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>TBD</p>
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace SampleApp.Pages
{
    public class SecureModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly ILogger<SecureModel> _logger;

        public SecureModel(ILogger<SecureModel> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public void OnGet()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

And then add a corresponding navigation element to `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` after the privacy list element.

```html
<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Secure">Secure</a>
</li>
```

Hit `control-C` to exit and then republish and restart.

We've added a page, but it sure isn't secure yet. Let's do that next.


Edit 

* fusionauth should already be configured. point back to prev post.
make a few changes
jwts
generate cert with correct values pic
SecurityTokenSignatureKeyNotFoundException/ certain algos

* create a new ASP.NET Core webapp.
branch setup-application

dotnet new webapp -o SampleApp
cd SampleApp

 dotnet publish -r win-x64

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/

publish and run
 bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win-x64/publish/SampleApp.exe

* disable https


* add a separate, secure page
* configure login stuff
make sure to update yoru appsettings.json
* show that it works (use newuser2@example.com)

logout
2nd post

Add in 
* the lambda to get favorite color
* and pkce
