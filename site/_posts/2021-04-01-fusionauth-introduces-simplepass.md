FusionAuth is proud to announce a breakthrough in user security. This new feature helps users around the world remember their passwords. It's long been known that passwords are easily forgotten, frustrating to end users, and generally a hassle.

The FusionAuth team, with decades of experience in security and software development, saw a clear market opportunity. They put their heads together and innovated.

"The feature is remarkably simple" said CTO Daniel DeGroff in an interview with the BBC. "We ask the user for their email address. And then we show them their password. We can even enter the characters for them if they don't have a keyboard handy. We looked at each other and said â€˜I can't believe nobody thought of this before'."

"We're disrupting passwords," Groff added. "This is how Jobs must have felt the first time he unveiled the iPod. Nothing will ever be the same."

CEO Brian Pontarelliwas skeptical at first, but when shown how easy it made logging into his email account, he was blown away. 

Said Pontarelli, "I thought WebAuthN was the future, but this is way simpler and more secure. Nothing is more secure than your eyes, and you use your eyes to read the password. I call it SimplePass(tm), because it's so simple. Way easier than SAML to understand."

As part of extensive user experience testing, FusionAuth presented two login forms to [Peter Starke, a systems analyst](https://www.theonion.com/most-popular-passwords-of-year-include-123456-password-1821529484). One was the typical username and password and the other used SimplePass(tm).

Peter was quick to choose the SimplePass form: "I mean, it types the password for me! Now I don't have to remember anything to log into my bank account. It's great! But not perfect. Maybe they could work on entering my email address too."

Since the announcement, FusionAuth has come under fire from industry security experts. They state that this feature, while helpful to users and a benefit to the login experience, may be open to exploit by experienced hackers.

We reached out to FusionAuth for further comment, and they issued the following statement: "Haters gonna hate, and you don't know crap about security."
