When a user is registering, you want to provide an on-brand look and feel, as well as a great user experience. In this tutorial, you'll improve an advanced registration form's display.

<!--more-->

Previously, we built a [self service registration form](TBD) for a real estate application. It was a two step form which captured specific information about their home buying needs. However, the form had a few rough user interface elements. In particular, it wasn't clear which data someone was supposed to enter into which form field.

This tutorial builds on the [previous one](TBD) and will walk you through changing the theme. While this tutorial will reference the previous form, you can adapt it to your own existing form as well.

## FusionAuth setup

Go to "Settings" and create an API key. We'll be using this for scripted theme management, so configure these allowed endpoints:

* `/api/theme`: all methods

You may also specify no specific endpoint settings. This creates a super-user key. Fine for this tutorial, but for production, please limit access.

## Creating a custom theme

The next step is to create a new theme. You will be changing some of the messages to improve the user experience, and the default theme is read-only. Themes are assigned on a tenant by tenant basis, so you can either change the theme for the default tenant (which is what this tutorial does) or create a new tenant and assign a new theme to that tenant. FusionAuth supports multiple tenants out of the box.

> This is the theme you'll modify throughout the rest of this blog post.

Navigate to "Customizations" and then "Themes". Duplicate the existing "FusionAuth" theme. Rename your theme to something meaningful, such as "Real Estate Application". Before you save it by clicking the blue "Save" icon, it should look like this:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/duplicate-theme.png" alt="Duplicate your theme to allow for customization." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Navigate to "Tenants" and then edit the "Default" tenant. Go to the "General" tab and update the "Login theme" setting to the new theme. Save the configuration when the screen looks like so:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/select-login-theme.png" alt="Select your new theme for the default tenant." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Customizing our theme

Customizing the theme gives you full control over what the user sees, both in terms of look and feel as well as the form fields available. As a reminder, here's what the first step of the registration flow looked like at the end of the form creation post:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/first-screen-unthemed.png" alt="The first page of the custom registration flow." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

We're going to add in understandable placeholders and some labels, but there's a lot more you can do; check out the [theming documentation](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) for more.

To begin, in the administrative user interface, navigate to "Customizations" and then "Themes". Copy the theme id which you created above; mine is `de03191a-9369-4732-a9c4-0467d1f26482`.

### Modifying a theme via API

To change the hints and validation messages, you must edit the messages file. This is a Java properties file, and can be changed via the administrative user interface or the API. In this post, you're going to use the API to make the changes. This will show the power of the API first approach that FusionAuth takes, as well as providing a way to version control the file, should you so desire.

> These scripts assume you are running FusionAuth at `http://localhost:9011`; if not, adjust accordingly. These scripts are [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-theme-management).

### Retrieving a theme file for local editing

First, retrieve the messages. You want them in a text file for easy editing. Below is a shell script which converts the JSON into a nice newline delimited file. Note that it assumes you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and python3 installed locally.

```shell
API_KEY=<your api key>
THEME_ID=<your theme id>

curl -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://localhost:9011/api/theme/'$THEME_ID|jq '.theme.defaultMessages' |sed 's/^"//' |sed 's/"$//' |python3 convert.py > defaultmessages.txt
```

The `convert.py` file turns embedded newlines into real ones:

```python
import sys

OUTPUT = sys.stdin.read()
formatted_output = OUTPUT.replace('\\n', '\n')
print(formatted_output)
```

While this script only works for the messages, it can be tweaked to handled other theme properties, such as each of the HTML template files. This is left as an exercise for the reader; pull requests welcome.

### Modifying the messages file

Add your API key and theme ID, then run the script. You'll end up with a `defaultmessages.txt` file in the current directory. This properties file looks like this:

```
#
# Copyright (c) 2019-2020, FusionAuth, All Rights Reserved
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");

# ...

# Webhook transaction failure
[WebhookTransactionException]=One or more webhooks returned an invalid response or were unreachable. Based on your transaction configuration, your action cannot be completed.
```

It's about 200 lines, so the above is an excerpt. Open it in your favorite text editor.

To improve the registration form, you'll add values to the "Custom Registration" section. Sections in this property file aren't enforced (it's not a `.ini` file) but it's a good idea to change only what is needed. Upgrades to FusionAuth may change the properties file and you will have merge the two sets of changes, so simpler is better. Here is the section to which you're going to add lines:

```
# ...
#
# Custom Registration forms. These must match the domain names.
#
user.email=Email
user.password=Password
user.birthDate=Birthdate

#
# Custom Registration form validation errors.
#
[confirm]user.password=Confirm password
# ...
```

The keys of the messages file must match the field keys for the registration form. Here's what you'd add to set up placeholders if you're following along.

```properties
user.firstName=Your first name
user.mobilePhone=Your mobile phone num
registration.data.minprice=Minimum home price
registration.data.maxprice=Maximum home price
registration.data.minprice=Where are you looking?
```

Add any validation messages to the section starting with: `# Custom Registration form validation errors.`. You can examine the `Default validation errors` section for examples of all the errors available. Append the key to provide specific errors for a given form field. For example, to display a nice error message when price range information is omitted, add these properties:

```properties
[blank]registration.data.minprice=Minimum home price required
[blank]registration.data.maxprice=Maximum home price required
```

If any of the values added have a double quote, escape it: `\"`. This prevents issues when this file is converted into JSON, which will happen before the changes are reflected in FusionAuth. 

### Updating the theme in FusionAuth

After you've made all your changes to `defaultmessages.txt`, you need to turn it back into the JSON format the API expects. You must also add the keys and quotes previously stripped off. Finally, you have to make the update request to FusionAuth. For the update, you should use the `PATCH` method, which only updates the elements of an object provided. This script performs all the above actions on the `defaultmessages.txt` file:

```shell
API_KEY=<your api key>
THEME_ID=<your theme id>

FILE_NAME=out.json$$

awk '{printf "%s", $0"\\n"}' defaultmessages.txt |sed 's/^/{ "theme": { "defaultMessages": "/' | sed 's/$/"}}/' > $FILE_NAME

STATUS_CODE=`curl -XPATCH -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" 'http://localhost:9011/api/theme/'$THEME_ID -d @$FILE_NAME -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -s`

if [ $STATUS_CODE -ne 200 ]; then
  echo "Error with patch, exited with status code: "$STATUS_CODE
  exit 1
fi

rm $FILE_NAME
```

Run this script with the modified `defaultMessages.txt` file. This will apply your changes to your theme. 

To view the changes, find the registration URL by going to the "Application" tab in the FusionAuth administrative user interface. View your application and copy the registration URL:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/advanced-registration-forms/viewing-application-details.png" alt="Finding the registration URL." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Open an incognito window and visit this URL. You should see nice placeholders on the first page:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/first-screen-themed.png" alt="The first page of the registration form with the correct messages added." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

If you fill out the first step, you'll see the the second page with the correct placeholders as well:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/second-screen-themed.png" alt="The second page of the registration form with the correct messages added." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

### Validation and theming

Validation works too. On the second screen, if you submit the registration form without providing a price range, you're shown the error messages you added above:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/themed-with-validation-second-screen.png" alt="The second page of the registration form with error messages." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Adding form labels

You can customize your field display more extensively by modifying the `customField` freemarker macro helper. This is in the "Helpers" section of your theme. Rather than use the API to do this, let's edit the helpers directly in the administrative user interface.

Navigate to "Themes" and edit your theme. Click on "Helpers" and scroll to the bbottom. You'll be modifying the `customField` macro. Here's the default implementation for this freemarker macro:

```
[#macro customField field key autofocus=false placeholder=""]
  [#assign fieldId = field.key?replace(".", "_") /]
  [#local leftAddon = field.data.leftAddon!'info' /]
  [#if field.control == "checkbox"]
    [#if field.options?has_content]
      [@checkbox_list field=field id="${fieldId}" name="${key}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus options=field.options /]
    [#else]
      [@checkbox field=field id="${fieldId}" name="${key}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus /]
    [/#if]
  [#elseif field.control == "number"]
    [@input id="${fieldId}" type="number" name="${key}" leftAddon="${leftAddon}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus placeholder=theme.optionalMessage(placeholder) /]
  [#elseif field.control == "password"]
    [@input id="${fieldId}" type="password" name="${key}" leftAddon="lock" autocomplete="new-password" autofocus=autofocus placeholder=theme.optionalMessage(placeholder)/]
  [#elseif field.control == "radio"]
    [@radio_list field=field id="${fieldId}" name="${key}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus options=field.options /]
  [#elseif field.control == "select"]
    [@select id="${fieldId}" name="${key}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus options=field.options /]
  [#elseif field.control == "textarea"]
    [@textarea id="${fieldId}" name="${key}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus placeholder=theme.optionalMessage(placeholder) /]
  [#elseif field.control == "text"]
    [#if field.type == "date"]
      [@input id="${fieldId}" type="text" name="${key}" leftAddon="${leftAddon}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus placeholder=theme.optionalMessage(placeholder) class="date-picker" dateTimeFormat="yyyy-MM-dd" /]
    [#else]
      [@input id="${fieldId}" type="text" name="${key}" leftAddon="${leftAddon}" required=field.required autofocus=autofocus placeholder=theme.optionalMessage(placeholder) /]
    [/#if]
  [/#if]
[/#macro]
```

It looks a little wonky if you aren't used to it, but this is a series of if/then statements which get executed against every custom field. The macro looks at each field and creates the correct HTML element for the configured data type and control. Well, technically, it calls another macro such as `input` or `select`, but you get what I mean. For instance, a `password` field will be rendered as an HTML input field with the type of `password`. 

Let's add a label to each field. Right after `[#assign fieldId = field.key?replace(".", "_") /]`, add this:

```
[#if fieldId == "user_firstName"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">First name:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "user_email"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Email:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "user_password"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Password:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "user_mobilePhone"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Mobile phone #:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "registration_data_geographicarea"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Where are you looking?:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "registration_data_minprice"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Minimum home price:</label>
[/#if]
[#if fieldId == "registration_data_maxprice"]
  <label for="${fieldId}">Maximum home price:</label>
[/#if]
```

When you are done, the `helpers` section should look like this:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/theme-editor.png" alt="The theme editor after modifying the custom fields helper." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Open an incognito window and go through a registration flow again. You should see labels for both steps. As a bonus, because you used the `label` HTML element, you can now click on the text label and the browser will put the cursor into the text input field. User experience win!

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/first-screen-with-labels.png" alt="The first registration step with labels." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

If you submit information for the first step, you can see labels are present on the second step as well:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/second-screen-with-labels.png" alt="The second registration step with labels." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Previewing a theme

It is generally a good idea to review a theme in an incognito window because this will give you intuition about the total user registration experience. However, at times, you may need to make small changes in your theme that you want to view without going through an entire registration process. You can easily do so by previewing the theme. 

Navigate to "Customizations" then to "Themes". Choose your theme, then click the preview link (the green magnifying glass). 

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/preview-theme-button.png" alt="Preview your theme." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Doing this will open a new tab. Click "OAuth register" in the left hand navigation and you'll see the theme as it would be rendered. You can even switch between steps. Below you can see the preview for the second step:

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/theming-advanced-forms/view-theme-preview.png" alt="Preview your theme." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

## Conclusion

This post reveals a glimpse of the full flexibility of FusionAuth themes. You can use the full power of [Apache Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/), Java ResourceBundles, CSS, and JavaScript to customize and localize these pages. As mentioned previously, it's also worth checking out the [theme documentation](/docs/v1/tech/themes). 

If you are using the FusionAuth registration forms, be sure to customize the default templates, both to improve user experience and also to make sure the brand is cohesive. FusionAuth's themes can be manipulated both in the administrative user interface and via the API.

But what about the information the user provides when they are registering? This user information is available via the FusionAuth APIs, in the `user.data` and `registration.data` fields. It is also available for viewing, but not editing, in the administrative user interface. 

You can retrieve and modify user data using the [APIs](/docs/v1/tech/apis) and in a future blog post we'll see exactly how to do that.
