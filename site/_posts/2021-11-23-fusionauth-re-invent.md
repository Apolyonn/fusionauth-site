AWS re:Invent is one of the largest gatherings of technical people. In the cloud space, it is the event to go to. In 2019, there were north of 50,000 attendees; this year the number of attendees is lower, but there'll still be a lot of folks.

The FusionAuth team will be among them, and we'd love to see you there.

We're going to re:Invent for a number of reasons. Both FusionAuth and our clients often develop and deploy on AWS. Some use straight up EC2 instances with RDS, others solutions like EKS and Fargate. re:Invent is a great chance to get to meet fellow developers, both during talks and the everpresent hallway track, to exchange ideas and knowledge.

We're also excited to chat with attendees. The AWS CIAM solution, [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), has some issues (as [some in the FusionAuth community](/blog/2020/11/18/reconinfosec-fusionauth/) have shared). We'd like to hear from developers who are using Cognito and are considering other solutions, such as FusionAuth.

We're also looking forward to some specific sessions. I personally am excited about "What's new is Amazon RDS", "Creating the best developer experience" and "Deep dive into high performance networking on AWS". While many of these appear on the Amazon Web Services Youtube Channel (here's a favorite of mine: [Becoming an AWS Policy Ninja using AWS IAM and AWS Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hETtXCqX_Zc)), I find the in-person experience to be superior in some ways.

Of course, it isn't all learning and talks. There's also some fun to be had. One activity definitely worth attending is [Corey Quinn's nature walk](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1461533923855331329). There are numerous parties; chances are at least one vendor has emailed with an invite you if you are attending. This twitter account, [@reInventParties](https://twitter.com/reInventParties/), is another way to discover them. Finally, someone recommended getting into nature and checking out [Red Rock Canyon](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/nevada/red-rock-canyon).

If you want to meet up with the FusionAuth team at re:Invent, we'd love to see you. You can find us in a couple of places:

* We're having an [TopGolf party on Monday](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aws-reinvent-kickoff-party-with-fusionauth-at-topgolf-tickets-186103098377). It's currently full, but please join the waitlist.
* We have a booth right across from the Developer Lounge in the Expo Hall. No map up yet, but [here's the Expo page](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/expo/). Brave the madness and come say hi for a demo, to chat about the intricacies of the Authorization Code grant, or to sign up for a couple of giveaways.
* Finally, we'll be out and about as well. You can send us a note on our [contact form](/contact/) or tweet/DM a team member who is active on Twitter: [Dan](https://twitter.com/mooreds), [Akira](https://twitter.com/theakirati), [Brian](https://twitter.com/bpontarelli), or [Daniel](https://twitter.com/robotdan220). We'd love to hear from you.
