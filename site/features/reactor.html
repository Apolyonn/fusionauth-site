        <h2 class="pb-2">What is FusionAuth Reactor?</h2>
        <p class="lh-4">Built from a fire-forged, vibranium-authenticatium alloy, FusionAuth Reactor is a suite of new features that extends FusionAuth's core functionality.</p>
        <p class="lh-4">When Reactor is activated, FusionAuth can connect to powerful cloud-based components that address specific identity challenges. Some focus on security, others on saving time in complex integrations. Enable one feature or the whole suite depending on your specific requirements.</p>

        <h2 class="pb-2">FusionAuth Reactor is Native Code</h2>
        <p class="lh-4">FusionAuth Reactor is native code, not a set of plug-ins or modules that get strapped onto the side of the core FusionAuth platform. We’ve seen this in other identity products, and know that it can hurt your speed, efficiency and security. </p>
        <p class="lh-4">Reactor components are architected directly into the FusionAuth platform so you don't make sacrifices for additional features. Our mission is to provide a fast, efficient, and secure identity solution that can work anywhere, and everything in Reactor keeps this in focus for every component.</p>

        <h2 class="pb-2">Breached Password Detection</h2>
        <p class="lh-4">The first feature available as part of Reactor is <strong>Breached Password Detection</strong>. We collected hundreds of millions of compromised usernames and passwords from numerous breached databases. FusionAuth can now check passwords to ensure that they don’t exist in any of these databases.</p>
          <p class="lh-4 font-weight-bold">Breached Password Detection can be enabled during these events:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Account creation</li>
              <li>Password reset or change</li>
              <li>During login</li>
            </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row flex-row-reverse pt-1">
      <div class="col-lg-12 pl-lg-5">
          <p class="lh-4">This flexibility allows for retroactive password clean-up for existing users as well as restricting the use of breached passwords for new users. When Reactor determines that a password has been breached, FusionAuth can be configured to take one of these actions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Force a password change</li>
              <li>Notify the user by email</li>
              <li>Mark the user as having a breached password for later reporting and action</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="lh-4 pt-2">Prevent Brute Force Attacks</h3>
          <p class="lh-4">By activating this feature and combining it with our already powerful password constraints, you can ensure your users are secure and using the latest recommended password rules. Plus, as new breached databases become available on the dark web, we’ll be adding them to Reactor and your FusionAuth will automatically be updated. This combination will help keep your users secure and prevent the most common brute force attack strategies.</p>
