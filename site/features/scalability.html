        <h2>Scales to 100s of Millions</h2>
        <p>
          Every aspect and component of FusionAuth was built to scale. Don't worry about things slowing down like other solutions. FusionAuth can always keep pace with even <a href="/blog/2019/02/26/got-users-100-million/">100s of millions of users</a>.

        <h2>Stateless APIs</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth's APIs are all stateless. This means that you can easily horizontally scale nodes to handle increased volume.

        <h2>Elastic Clustering</h2>
        <p>
          FusionAuth uses Elasticsearch for our full-text search engine. Elasticsearch can be clustered and horizontally scaled to meet your needs.
