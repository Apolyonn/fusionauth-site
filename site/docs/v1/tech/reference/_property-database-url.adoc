The JDBC URL that FusionAuth can use to connect to the configured database.

Consider the examples below and review each part of the URL string as you may need to adjust it for your configuration.

jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/fusionauth
+
    * Database type: PostgreSQL
    * Database host: db
    * Database port: 5432
    * Database name: fusionauth
+
In the example above, notice we have specified the PostgreSQL jdbc type, a host of `db`, a port `5432` and a database name of `fusionauth`. The host is the service name of the database configuration, in this case it is named `db`.

jdbc:mysql://db:3306/fusionauth?serverTimezone=UTC
+
    * Database type: MySQL
    * Database host: db
    * Database port: 3306
    * Database name: fusionauth
    * Server timezone: UTC
+
In the example above, notice we have specified the MySQL jdbc type, a host of `db`, a port `3306`, a database name of `fusionauth`, and the server timezone `UTC`.
+
If you are using MySQL, you must include the `serverTimezone=UTC` parameter in the URL. The `?` character is the same as a standard URL parameter, so if you have additional parameters, you should only have a single `?` and parameters should be separated by `&`.

You may also wish to connect to a remote database, in that case you will provide your own JDBC string URL specifying the remote database host and port.
