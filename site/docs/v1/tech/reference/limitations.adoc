FusionAuth has the following known limits.

=== User searches

When using the Elasticsearch search engine, the maximum number of users returned for any search is Searches for users cannot return more than 10,000 users. There is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/494[open bug] tracking this issue.

==== Workarounds

Limit the search query to return less than 10,000 users. Make multiple queries if needed. For example, if you needed to pull all of your users, you could query for users with an email address starting with `A`, then with `B`, and so on.

=== Field lengths

FusionAuth stores most data in a database. Lengths of fields are documented in the database schema for your database type. Please link:/direct-download[download the database schema] to review limits for a particular column.

Any varchar column that is indexed has a length of 191. Why 191? In MySQL when using a `utf8mb4` (4 byte character set) on an indexed column, MySQL limits the usable characters to 191 to account for the overhead of the 4 byte addressing.
