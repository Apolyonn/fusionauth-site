The FusionAuth runtime mode. The runtime mode causes some features to be modified based upon this configuration.

The possible values are:
+
  * `development`
  * `production`
+
When in the `development` runtime mode, maintenance mode will interactively assist you configuring the database and connecting to Elasticsearch if configured. Once you move FusionAuth into production, it is recommended that you modify the runtime mode to `production`. When in `production` runtime mode maintenance mode will no longer be available to you which means you can be certain that your end users will not find themselves on the database upgrade panel during an Upgrade. When in `production` mode you will need to manage your database schema updates out of band.
