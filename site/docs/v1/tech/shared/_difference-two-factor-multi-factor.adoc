You might be wondering, what is the difference between multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two factor authentication (2FA)? (A factor is anything a user provides or is that shows who they are. The end goal of authentication, after all, is to be assured that whoever is behind the request is who they say they are.)

When a system can support more than one method of authentication, it supports MFA. For example, FusionAuth supports a code sent to a phone or email and a time-based one-time password (TOTP) based on a shared secret stored in Google Authenticator or another similar application.

2FA typically occurs when a user provides two factors at the moment of login. In FusionAuth, one of those factors will always be a password.
