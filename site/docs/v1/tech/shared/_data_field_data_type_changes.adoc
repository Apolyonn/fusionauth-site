FusionAuth provides `data` fields on the `user` and `registration` objects. You should not modify the data type of fields stored in `data`. 

For example, you could create a field called `user.data.migrated` and store a boolean value in it. If you later set that field to a string value for any user, subsequent user searches will fail if you are using the Elasticsearch search engine.

If you are using the Elasticsearch search engine, the `data` fields are indexed by Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch requires fields to have the same data type across all indexed objects. In the example above, once Elasticsearch "knows" that `user.data.migrated` is a boolean, it expects this field, if present, to be a boolean for all users. This limitation applies only to installations using the Elasticsearch search engine. 

However, if you start with the database search engine and eventually need to switch to the Elasticsearch search engine because the database search engine no longer meets your needs, if you have not enforced consistency in the `data` field types, you will not be able to do so.
