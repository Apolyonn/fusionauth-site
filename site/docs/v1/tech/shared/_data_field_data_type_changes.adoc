FusionAuth provides `data` fields on many types of objects:

* Applications
* Tenants
* Groups
* Users
* Registrations
* Consent

If you are using the Elasticsearch search engine, the `user.data` and `registration.data` fields are indexed by Elasticsearch.

For example, you could create a field called `user.data.migrated` and store a boolean value in it. If you later set that field to a string value for any user, subsequent user searches will fail if you are using the Elasticsearch search engine.

Elasticsearch requires fields to have the same data type across all indexed objects. In the example above, once Elasticsearch "knows" that `user.data.migrated` is a boolean, it expects this field, if present, to be a boolean for all users.

Therefore, you should not modify the data type of fields stored in the `user.data` and `registration.data` fields. 

In addition, other object `data` fields may in the future be indexed by Elasticsearch. Therefore, it is recommended to have a consistent schema for all `data` fields.

This limitation applies only to installations using the Elasticsearch search engine. However, if you start with the database search engine and eventually need to switch to the Elasticsearch search engine because the database search engine no longer meets your needs, if you have not enforced consistency in the `data` field types, you will not be able to do so.
