FusionAuth provides `data` fields on the `user` and `registration` objects. 

You should not modify the data type of fields stored in `data` over time. 

For example, if you create a field called `user.data.migrated` and store a boolean value in it, if you later set that field to a string value for any user, subsequent user searches will fail.

`data` fields are indexed by Elasticsearch, if you are using the Elasticsearch search engine. Elasticsearch requires fields to have the same data type across all indexed objects. In the example above, once Elasticsearch sees that `user.data.migrated` is a boolean, it expects that field, if present, to be a boolean on all users.

This limitation applies only to installations using the Elasticsearch search engine. However, if you start with the database search engine and eventually need to switch to the Elasticsearch search engine, you will not be able to do so if you have not enforced consistency in the `data` field types.
