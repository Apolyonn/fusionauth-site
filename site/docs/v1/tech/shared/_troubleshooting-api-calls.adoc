When your API call isn't working, taking the following steps can help you troubeleshoot it.

Use the REST API directly. While the client libraries are useful abstractions, removing them helps narrow down the issues. Curl or wget are great choices.

When using a command line tool like curl, make sure you set the headers appropriately. These headers are commonly forgotten:

* `Authorization` which is the API key in most cases. Review the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/authentication[API Authentication] documentation for more information.
* `Content-type` which is almost always `application/json` for anything not  `GET` request, and can be omitted for `GET` requests. If you don't specify this header when making a non-`GET` API call, you will see an unexpected error.
* `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` which is only required when you have two or more tenants and the tenant cannot be inferred from the request or API key. However, you can always provide this header.

Additionally, it can be helpful to copy and paste the JSON body from the documentation for the call you are trying to debug.

If you are seeing a `401` error, confirm that the API key has the required permissions. Test with a 'super user' key.

Make sure you are making requests of the correct host and that your proxy, if using one, passes API requests correctly.
