When interacting with FusionAuth from a client side application, such as a React or Angular front end, you have a few options.

If you are authenticating the user, use the standard OAuth Authorization Code grant.
You can either forward the browser or webview to FusionAuth or use an iframe.

If you are using one of the APIs which requires no authentication or JWT authenticcation, such as the change password API, you can interact directly with the API.
These APIs tend to be more limited in functionality when no API key is presented, but may suit your needs.

If you need to use an API requiring authentication from client code, such as the registration API, you have two options:

* Use a server side component which can securely hold the API key and monitor access for abuse.
Have your client send requests to the server side component.
This is the *recommended option*.
* Create an API key with extremely limited permissions and distribute it.
Stealing the key when used on the client side is trivial--all an attacker has to do is 'view source'.
Make sure you have carefully considered the risk and result of someone stealing and using the key outside of your application.
You can also monitor FusionAuth usage using webhooks, use IP ACLs to limit where the API key can be used from, or place an HTTP proxy in front of FusionAuth to further monitor and limit access.
