When interacting with FusionAuth from a client side application, such as a React or Angular front end, you have a few options.

If you are authenticating the user, use the standard OAuth Authorization Code grant.
You can either forward the browser or webview to FusionAuth or use an iframe.

If you are using one of the APIs which requires no authentication or JWT authenticcation, such as the change password API, you can interact directly with the API.
These APIs tend to be more limited in functionality when no API key is presented, but may suit your needs.

If you need to use an API requiring authentication from client code, such as the registration API, you have two options:

* Create an API key with extremely limited permissions and distribute it.
Make sure you threat model the ramifications of someone stealing the key and using it.
You can also monitor FusionAuth usage using webhooks, use IP ACLs to limit where the API key can be used from, or place an HTTP proxy in front of FusionAuth to further monitor and limit access.
Plan to link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/key-rotation[rotate the key regularly] to limit the impact.
* Use a server side component which can securely hold the API key and have access monitored for abuse.
Then have your client send requests to the server side component.
