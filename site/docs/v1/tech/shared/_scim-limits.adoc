The current SCIM implementation does not support:

* Patch operations
* Bulk operations
* Query operations

All of these operations are available via link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[FusionAuth APIs], but are not currently supported via SCIM compatible endpoints. If this functionality is required, please file a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] explaining your use case.

You cannot create a FusionAuth Registration for a user provisioned with SCIM. If you need to register the user for one or more Applications, you have a few options. You may:

* use the link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/scim-user-request-converter[SCIM User Request Converter Lambda].
* use the link:https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/events/user-create-complete[`user.create.complete` webhook].

Either works. The correct choice depends on if you want to do the processing within FusionAuth using a lambda or using an external server.

While it is not a limitation, it is recommended to configure at most one SCIM server per tenant.

While you can have multiple SCIM servers per configured within one tenant, at the end of the day you only have one user data store per tenant.

Conflicts with creation, updated and deletion could happen; they won't be automatically resolved by FusionAuth. If you need to use multiple SCIM servers, ensure your clients can handle such conflicts.
