The current SCIM implementation does not support:

* List operations
* Patch operations
* Bulk operations
* Query operations

All of these operations are available via link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[FusionAuth APIs], but are not currently supported via SCIM compatible endpoints. If this functionality is required, please file a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] explaining your use case.

You cannot create a FusionAuth Registration for a user provisioned with SCIM. If you need to register the user for one or more Applications, you have a few options. You may:

* use the link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/scim-user-request-converter[SCIM User Request Converter Lambda].
* use the link:https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/events/user-create-complete[`user.create.complete` webhook].

Either will suffice; the correct choice depends on if you want to do the processing within FusionAuth and the Lambbda runtime, or using an external server.

While it is not a limitation, it is recommended to configure at most one SCIM server per tenant.
