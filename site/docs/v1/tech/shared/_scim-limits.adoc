The current SCIM implementation does not support:

* List operations
* Patch operations
* Bulk operations
* Query operations

All of these operations are available via link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[FusionAuth APIs], but are not currently supported via SCIM compatible endpoints. If this functionality is required, please file a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] explaining your use case.

While it is not a limitation, it is recommended to configure at most one SCIM server per tenant.
