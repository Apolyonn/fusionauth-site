The current SCIM implementation does not support:

* List operations
* Patch operations
* Query operations

All of these operations are available via FusionAuth APIs, but they aren't currently supported via SCIM compatible endpoints. If this functionality is required, please file a https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] explaining your use case.
