Permissions associated with the grant from the target entity to the recipient entity will be available in the `permissions` claim in the token. If specific permissions are requested, the recipient entity must have previously been granted all of those permissions for a successful access request. If any permissions are requested, only the requested permissions will be placed in the `permissions` claim, otherwise all permissions associated will be placed in that claim.
