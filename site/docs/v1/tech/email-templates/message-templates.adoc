== Overview

FusionAuth will use message templates to send a codes to users who have chosen an SMS MFA method. This is currently the only built-in workflow which uses message templates. 

You may also create your own message templates with localized content and manage them using FusionAuth.

* <<Localization>>
* <<Templates & Replacement Variables>>

== Managing Templates

FusionAuth ships with no templates to support the MFA workflows. You will want to create templates prior to using them in production.

When you first log into FusionAuth and navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Message Templates# you will be able to add a new template. You may add as many templates as you'd like.

=== Base Information

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
The unique Id of the message template. The template Id may not be changed and will be used to interact with the template when using the APIs.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
The name of the template. This value is for display purposes only and can be changed at any time.

[field]#Type# [required]#Required#::
The type of the template. `SMS` is the only value currently supported.

== Localization

The message template body can be localized. 

You can associate the template text values with a locale. If a user has a preferred language, the localized template will be used when this text message is sent.

== Templates & Replacement Variables

The message template body support replacement variables. This means place holders can be inserted and the value will be calculated at the time the message template is rendered and sent to a user.

Most templates will contain the User object as returned on the Retrieve User API. This means you can utilize any value found on the User object such as email, first name, last name, etc.

Below you will find each stock template that FusionAuth ships for reference. The available replacement values will be outlined below for each template.
