== Docker Compose

All of the FusionAuth Docker images may be found on https://hub.docker.com/u/fusionauth/[Docker Hub]. If you're looking for a complete configuration to get up and running quickly, use our Docker Compose example. The following is an example and it may not be the most recent version. Refer to the following link in https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml[GitHub] to find the latest version.

```
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
```

The stock `.env` file will contain the following values, you will want to modify the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values are correct. You may also override any of these values using environment variables.

```
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_USER=fusionauth
DATABASE_PASSWORD=hkaLBM3RVnyYeYeqE3WI1w2e4Avpy0Wd5O3s3

ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx256m

FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY=256M
```

The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth using the database for the user search engine:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - 54320:5432
    networks:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  fusionauth:
    image: fusionauth/fusionauth-app:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/fusionauth
      DATABASE_ROOT_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      DATABASE_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      DATABASE_USER: ${DATABASE_USER}
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
      FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY: ${FUSIONAUTH_MEMORY}
      FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_ENGINE_TYPE: database
      FUSIONAUTH_URL: http://fusionauth:9011
    networks:
     - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9011:9011
    volumes:
      - fa_config:/usr/local/fusionauth/config

networks:
  db:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db_data:
  fa_config:
```

The following is an example `docker-compose.yml` file configuring FusionAuth using Elasticsearch for the user search engine:
```yaml

    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  search:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.6.1
    environment:
      - cluster.name=fusionauth
      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true
      - discovery.type=single-node

      FUSIONAUTH_URL: http://fusionauth:9011
    networks:
     - db
     - search
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9011:9011
    volumes:

  es_data:
  fa_config:
```

== Docker Services
In the above example configuration you will find a database, search and FusionAuth service. Read below to better understand how each service is configured.

=== Database Service

At a minimum, you wil need to either set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `db` service section, or more ideally set the value in the host environment and leave it out of the `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure the other properties fit your requirements. Refer to the link:system-requirements[System Requirements] for database version support.

=== Search Service

We currently support Elasticsearch versions 6.3.x - 7.6.x, do not modify the image value to a version outside of this range. Let us know if you have a requirement for a different version of Elasticsearch. The remainder of the properties can be changed to whatever you need.

If you would like to add additional search nodes, simply copy and paste the service section named `search` and create as many as you'd like naming them `search2`, `search3` for example. Each will require a named volume, you may increment the name of the volume as well, for example `es_data1`, `es_data2`, `es_data3`, etc.

////
TODO - 1.16.0 - In order to configure multiple nodes in v7.6.x, what do we need to modify the `discovery.type` value to, and what do we set `cluster.initial_master_nodes` to?
////

=== FusionAuth Service

==== Configuration
Review the link:../reference/configuration#environment-variables[Configuration - Environment Variables] documentation to customize your deployment.

== Production Deployment

Elasticsearch has a few runtime requirements that may not be met by default on your host platform. Please review the Elasticsearch Docker production mode guide for more information.

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode

For example if startup is failing and you see the following in the logs, you will need to increase `vm.max_map_count` on your host VM.
