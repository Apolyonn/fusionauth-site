title: FusionAuth Cloud
description: FusionAuth Cloud is FusionAuth in the cloud, managed by us
---

== Overview 

FusionAuth Cloud is an entirely managed FusionAuth instance in the cloud. As the owner of that server, you have complete access to the the administrative user interface and can create API keys and manage the instance via client libraries or APIs. But you have no access to the servers or networks where the instance runs.

With FusionAuth Cloud, you create "deployments". A deployment is a FusionAuth instance, a database, a search application, and all the necessary networking configuration to connect your FusionAuth deployment to the internet. 

You can create as many deployments as you want and tear them down when you do not need them. You pay only for the time each deployment is running.

Every deployment is separated, both logically and physically, from every other deployments. There is no network path between deployments except over the internet. There is no shared database or other storage infrastructure.

== Why Use FusionAuth Cloud

FusionAuth Cloud is a fully managed service which can be used for many use cases. Among them:

* Proof of concepts 
* FusionAuth trials
* Testing new versions without affecting prod
* Development servers
* High availability production environments

With FusionAuth Cloud, spin up a functioning FusionAuth instance in minutes. This allows you to get to work testing or integrating with FusionAuth, rather than installing or configuring it. 

If you want to use FusionAuth and hand all the management burden to the team who built it, FusionAuth Cloud is a good choice.

== What Does FusionAuth Cloud Cost

Unlike other installation options, **FusionAuth Cloud costs money**. You cannot create a FusionAuth Cloud deployment without a credit card or invoicing agreement.

For full pricing information as well as different deployment architectures, please visit link:/pricing/cloud/[the pricing page, window="_blank"]. You can also find the expected cost without creating an account by using the link:https://account.fusionauth.io/price-calculator[pricing calculator, window="_blank"]. You can choose the cloud option, the deployment region, and the number of monthly active users.

== How To Use FusionAuth Cloud

There are a few steps to getting access to a deployment. Some occur once, others happen every time a new deployment is created. 

Control all aspects of FusionAuth Cloud deployments by logging into the link:https://account.fusionauth.io/[account portal, window="_blank"]. 

=== Portal Sections

Your account portal contains the following tabs:

* [breadcrumb]#Editions# - select or modify the account's FusionAuth edition. More details on the link:/pricing/[edition differences here]. This is also where you will find your license keys if you are not using the Community edition.
* [breadcrumb]#Deployments# - configure and manage FusionAuth Cloud deployments.
* [breadcrumb]#Users# - add and remove users from the account portal.
* [breadcrumb]#Billing# - add or update your billing information.
* [breadcrumb]#Support# - learn more about support options or open a support ticket.

[NOTE.info]
====
Adding a user to your company will allow them to manage FusionAuth deployments and take other account portal actions. This action will *not* provision the user an account on the FusionAuth instance in the deployment.
====

=== Setting Up Your Account and Billing

Before you can create a FusionAuth deployment, you register for a free account and provide payment information. Register by going to https://account.fusionauth.io/[the account portal]. 

If you already have an account, you can log in.

image::installation-guides/cloud/login-screen.png[Registering for an account,width=1200,roles=bottom-cropped,top-cropped]

If you do not, navigate to the "Create an account" link. On the registration form, you'll be prompted for an email, password and other required information.

image::installation-guides/cloud/register.png[Registering for an account,width=1200,roles=bottom-cropped,top-cropped]

After you register, you'll be taken to the [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab. If you have no billing information on file, you'll need to provide that before creating a deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/add-billing-information.png[Entering billing information,width=1200]

You can navigate away from the [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab and explore other areas of the account portal. For example, you can add other users. 

But before creating a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, provide credit card details. If you'd prefer to be invoiced, please link:/contact/[contact us]. Invoicing requires a certain minimum monthly charge. XXX

After you have created an account and set up your billing information, create a deployment. 

=== Creating a Deployment

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab. If you have no deployments, you will see a screen like this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-tab-no-deployments.png[On the Deployments tab with no deployments,width=1200,roles=bottom-cropped]

Click the "Launch" button to start your first FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

==== Provisioning Your Deployment

In order to create the correct FusionAuth instance, you need to specify aspects of the deployment. Pick the tier of this deployment: Basic, Business or High-Availability. Each has different data durability guarantees.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-initial.png[Initial provisioning screen,width=1200]

Supported regions include North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, South America and the Middle East. Within each region, select a geographic area, such as Oregon, USA. 

This allows you to pick the location that meets your legal and compliance needs.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-selecting-region-tier.png[Choosing your region,width=1200]

Next, pick the deployment size. This section includes guidance on how many logins per second can be supported. You can also specify the FusionAuth version, data compliance attributes and vanity URL of the deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-choosing-size.png[Choosing your deployment size and vanity URL,width=1200]

[NOTE]
====
The screenshots above are for a Basic FusionAuth Cloud deployment. Different deployments will show different options.
====

At the end of the provisioning process, before your credit card is charged, you will be provided an estimate of the monthly cost. When you have your deployment configured as you would like, click "Launch Deployment". When you do this, your credit card will be charged.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-show-cost-launch-deployment.png[Estimated cost is displayed,width=1200,roles=top-cropped]

==== Deployment Creation

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab to see the new deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-provisioning.png[Deployment tab when the provisioning is occurring,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

The exact duration of the deployment process depends on system load as well as the tier chosen. Expect your deployment to be available in 5 to 30 minutes. When the deployment is ready, the link to your deployment will be live and the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab will look similar to this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-active.png[Deployment tab when the provisioning finished,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Next, log in to the deployment's administrative user interface by clicking on the deployment's URL, such as \https://piedpiper-dev.fusionauth.io. 

At that point the link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard] will begin. There you can configure FusionAuth by creating API keys, adding additional users, setting up applications for your users to log in to, or any other task. The interface will be exactly the same as a self hosted FusionAuth instance.

If new to FusionAuth, you might want to work through the /docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/#5-create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings[5 minute guide], starting at step 5.

=== Managing Your Deployments

At any time you can log in to the account portal, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Deployments# and manage your deployments. To add more, click "Launch deployment". You'll go through the same provisioning workflow as above, and end up with another FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-launch-deployment.png[Launch deployment button,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You can also upgrade or destroy each deployment. To begin either process, select the menu under "Actions":

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-manage.png[Manage deployment,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

=== Upgrading a Deployment

If your deployment is not running the latest version of FusionAuth, you may upgrade it. Do so at a time that works for you and your systems by first https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[logging into your account]. Manage the deployment, then choose the "Upgrade" option. 

[NOTE]
====
Upgrading is only available if the deployment is not currently running the latest available FusionAuth version. 
====

You will then be prompted to confirm the upgrade:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-upgrade-confirm.png[Upgrading a deployment,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

There will be downtime of between 5 minutes and 60 minutes. The exact downtime duration depends on the type of deployment, amount of data in your system, and database changes required by the version upgrade. Consult the link:/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/[relevant release notes] for functional changes as well. 

Due to this downtime, it is recommended that you schedule the upgrade for a low traffic period. Test the upgrade process on development or test servers first.

XXX we stand up new server and then flip dns, right?
XXX how does this work with HA systems?

The recommendation is to run the latest released version of FusionAuth. However, you will never be forced to upgrade. XXX

You cannot downgrade a FusionAuth Cloud deployment version. XXX do we do anything before an upgrade (automatic backup?) if not, what is the rollback option

=== Destroying a Deployment

If you have a FusionAuth deployment and want to delete it, do so by https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[logging into your account]. Then manage the deployment in question. Choose the [field]#Destroy# option.

[NOTE.warning]
====
Make sure you have obtained a backup or otherwise retrieved a copy of your data. Once an deployment is destroyed, there is no way of retrieving the data. 
====

First, manage the deployment and select the "Destroy" option.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-prepare-destroy.png[Begin the process of destroying a deployment,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Then you will be prompted to confirm your decision.

image::installation-guides/cloud/delete-deployment-confirm.png[Confirming the deployment destruction,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After confirmation, the deployment will transition to a "Destroying" state.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-destroying.png[The deployment is being destroyed,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After destruction is complete, the deployment will have a "Destroyed" state. You will no longer be charged for this deployment.

== Modifying Deployment Characteristics

In general FusionAuth deployments are immutable. 

If you want to change the size of your deployment plan, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].
XXX add to TOC, verify this is the proper channel

To modify the tier of your FusionAuth Cloud installation, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].
XXX add to TOC, verify this is the proper channel

== Accessing User Data 

If you need to export user data from FusionAuth Cloud, whether because you are migrating away from FusionAuth or because you need raw user data for analytics or some other purpose, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].

A support request is required because backups contain sensitive data, like password hashes. The FusionAuth team will work with you to provide a safe data transfer mechanism.

If you need to download user data frequently, please consider using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/[API] or a link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/[webhook]. If these solutions won't meet your needs, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] to discuss options.

=== Restoring From Backup

Certain FusionAuth Cloud tiers which include regular backups. If you need to restore your instance from a backup, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket] with the details.

XXX RDS point in time backups?

== Support

Support for FusionAuth Cloud is limited to issues related to running your FusionAuth Cloud deployments. You can view support options by navigating to the [breadcrumb]#Support# tab:

image::installation-guides/cloud/support-tab.png[The support tab,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Support from the engineering team for integrating with FusionAuth is purchased separately through an edition with support. XXX still true? If you have such questions and have not purchased a support contract, find support via our link:/community/forum[forums] and link:/docs/v1/tech/[documentation]. 

Please review link:/technical-support/[the technical support page] for more support guidance.

== Custom FusionAuth Cloud Features

If the managed FusionAuth hosting does not meet your needs, please either link:/contact/[contact us] to discuss it.

Alternatively, you may https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[file a GitHub issue] detailing your use case.

== Limits

FusionAuth Cloud has the same link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/limitations/[limitations] as self hosted FusionAuth. Since it is a managed service, there are additional limitations as well:

* There is no API to manage FusionAuth Cloud deployments. XXX add
* You cannot change any of the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[FusionAuth configuration options]. 
* You cannot downgrade the version of a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.
* You cannot modify the region, size, or tier of a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.
* You cannot reuse deployment URLS. Once an deployment has been created and then destroyed, that url is reserved and cannot be reused.


QUESTIONS
XXX What does production flag do? I don't think anything from looking in fusionauth-cloud?

custom URL XXX

XXX do we delete backups on desctruction too? I am guessing yes.

the page doens't refresh in FF or safari for admins. not sure about normal users, but you have to hard refresh to see change in deployment state.

can you change the url?

Can you modify the fusionauth size from medium to large ? I don't see a self service option for that.
