== What is FusionAuth Cloud

FusionAuth Cloud is an entirely managed FusionAuth server. 

You have complete access to the system via the administrative user interface and API keys. But you have no access to the servers or networks on which the instance runs.

With FusionAuth Cloud, you create "deployments". A deployment is a FusionAuth instance, a database, and all the necessary networking configuration to connect your FusionAuth deployment. You can create as many deployments as you want. Tear them down when you do not need them.

Each deployment is separated from all other deployments. There is no network path between them. 

== What Does FusionAuth Cloud Cost

Unlike other installation options, FusionAuth Cloud is not free. You cannot create a FusionAuth Cloud deployment without a credit card or invoicing agreement.

For full pricing information as well as different deployment architectures, please visit link:/pricing/cloud/[the pricing page].

You can also find out your expected cost without creating an account or any commitment by using our pricing calculator. You can choose the cloud option, the deployment region, and the number of monthly active users.

You can also select the edition you would like to use. If FusionAuth's core features are sufficient, choose the Community edition. If you need premium features or support, select an edition that works for you.

== Why Use FusionAuth Cloud

FusionAuth Cloud is a fully managed service which can be used for:

* Proof of concepts or trials
* Testing new versions of FusionAuth
* Development environments
* High availability production environments

You can spin up a functioning server in minutes, and get to work testing or integrating FusionAuth, rather than configuring it. 

If you want to use FusionAuth and offload all the management burden to the people who built it, FusionAuth Cloud is a good choice.

== How To Use FusionAuth Cloud

There are a few steps to getting access to your deployment. Some only happen once, others happen every time you spin up a new deployment. You will control everything by logging into your account portal.

=== Portal Sections

Your account portal contains the following tabs:

* [breadcrumb]#Editions# - select your FusionAuth edition. More details on the link:/pricing/[edition differences here].
* [breadcrumb]#Deployments# - configure and manage your FusionAuth Cloud deployments.
* [breadcrumb]#Users# - add and remove users from the account portal.
* [breadcrumb]#Billing# - add or update your billing information.
* [breadcrumb]#Support# - learn more about support or open a support ticket.

[NOTE.info]
====
Adding a user to your company will allow them to manage FusionAuth deployments and take other account portal actions. This action will *not* provision the user an account on the FusionAuth instance in the deployment.
====

=== Initial Steps

Before you can stand up a FusionAuth deployment, you must create a free account and provide payment information.

Register by going to https://account.fusionauth.io and creating an account. You'll be prompted for a username, password and other required information.

image::installation-guides/cloud/register.png[Registering for an account,width=1200]

If you already have an account, you have to log in.

image::installation-guides/cloud/login-screen.png[Registering for an account,width=1200]

If you have no billing information on file, you'll need to provide that before you can create a deployment.

image::installation-guides/cloud/add-billing-information.png[Entering billing information,width=1200]

You can navigate away from the [breadcrumb]#Billing# tab and explore other areas of the account portal. But before you can create a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, you'll have to provide credit card details. If you'd prefer to be invoiced, please link:/contact/[contact us]. There is a minimum monthly amount in this situation. XXX

After you have created an account and set up your billing information, you can create a deployment. 

=== Creating a Deployment

Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab. When you are first here, you will see a screen like this:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-tab-no-deployments.png[On the Deployments tab with no deployments,width=1200]

Click the "Launch" button to set up your first FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

==== Provisioning Your Deployment

You need to select various aspects of your deployment. First you need to pick the size of your FusionAuth deployment:

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-initial.png[Initial provisioning screen,width=1200]

Then you should pick your region, including the specific geographic location such as Oregon or Montreal.

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-selecting-region-tier.png[Choosing your region and tier,width=1200]

Then, pick the size of your deployment. 

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-choosing-size.png[Choosing your deployment size,width=1200]

Finally, pick the FusionAuth version, data compliance and URL of your deployment:

image::installation-guides/cloud/provisioning-select-version-url.png[Choosing your deployment version and URL,width=1200]

The screenshots above were for a basic FusionAuth cloud deployment. Different deployments have different options.

You'll get an estimate of your monthly cost as you make your selections. When you have your deployment configured as you would like, click "Launch Deployment".

TBD highlight

==== Deployment Creation

If you visit the deployments tab, you'll see that provisioning is occurring. 

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-provisioning.png[Deployment tab when the provisioning is occurring,width=1200]

The exact time frame depends on system load and the cloud option you chose, but expect your deployment to be available in 5 to 15 minutes. When the deployment is ready for your use, the [breadcrumb]#Deployments# tab will look like this, and the link to your deployment will be live:

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-active.png[Deployment tab when the provisioning finished,width=1200]

To access your deployment's administrative user interface, visit the deployment's URL. You'll be sent to the link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/setup-wizard/[Setup Wizard] where you can configure an admin account. From there, create your API keys, add additional users, set up applications for your users to log in to, or perform any other task you would with a self hosted FusionAuth instance.

If you are new to FusionAuth, you might want to work through the /docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/#5-create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings[5 minute guide, starting at step 5].

=== Managing Your Deployments

At any time you can log in, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Deployments# and manage your deployments.

If you want to add more, click "Launch deployment". You'll be provided with all the provisioning choices you went through above.

TBD highlight 

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-launch-deployment.png[Launch deployment button,width=1200]

For an individual deployment, you can also either upgrade or destroy the deployment. To do either, you select the menu under "Actions".

=== Upgrading a Deployment

If your deployment is not running the latest version of FusionAuth, you may upgrade it. You can do so at a time that works for you and your systems by https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[logging into your account]. Manage the deployment, then choose "Upgrade". This option will be only be present if the instance is not running the latest available FusionAuth version. You will then be prompted to confirm the upgrade.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-upgrade-confirm.png[Upgrading a deployment,width=1200]

Expect downtime when upgrading of between 5 minutes and 60 minutes. The exact period of downtime depends on the type of deployment, amount of data in your system, and the upgrade scenario. Consult the release notes for details about functional changes as well. 

It is recommended that you schedule the upgrade for a low traffic period and that you test the upgrade functionality on development or test servers first.

XXX we stand up new server and then flip dns, right?
XXX how does this work with HA systems?

However, you will never be forced to upgrade, though the recommendation is to run the latest released version. XXX

You cannot downgrade a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

==== Restoring From Backup

If you have a FusionAuth Cloud plan which includes backups and you want to restore from a backup, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].

==== Destroying an Deployment

If you have a running FusionAuth deployment and want to shut it down, you can do so by https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[logging into your account] and manage the deployment in question. Choose the [field]#Destroy# option.

[NOTE.warning]
====
Make sure you have obtained a backup or otherwise retrieved a copy of your data. Once an deployment is destroyed, there is no way of retrieving the data on it. 
====

First, manage the deployment and select the "Destroy" option.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-prepare-destroy.png[Begin the process of destroying a deployment,width=1200]

Then you will be prompted to confirm your decision.

image::installation-guides/cloud/delete-deployment-confirm.png[Confirming the deployment destruction,width=1200]

After confirmation, the deployment will transition to a "Destroying" state.

image::installation-guides/cloud/deployments-destroying.png[The deployment is being destroyed,width=1200]

After destruction is complete, the deployment will have a "Destroyed" state.


== Leaving FusionAuth Cloud

If you'd like to get your user data out of FusionAuth Cloud, whether because you are migrating away from FusionAuth or because you need raw user data for analytics or some other purpose, please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].

A support request is required because backups contain sensitive data, such as password hashes. We need to work with you to provide a safe mechanism to transfer the data.

If you need to download user data frequently, please consider using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis[API] or a link:/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/[webhook]. If these solutions won't meet your needs, please link:/contact/[contact us] to discuss options.

== Support

Support for FusionAuth Cloud is limited to running your FusionAuth Cloud deployments. You can view options by navigating to the [breadcrumb]#Support# tab:

image::installation-guides/cloud/support-tab.png[The support tab,width=1200]

Support from the engineering team for integrating with FusionAuth is purchased separately through an edition with support. XXX still true? Integration support via our link:/community/forum[forums] and link:/docs/v1/tech/[documentation] is available at no cost. Please review link:/technical-support/[the technical support page] for more information on support.

== Additional Customization

If you need additional features for managed FusionAuth hosting, please either link:/contact/[contact us] or https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[file a GitHub issue] detailing your use case.

== Limits

There is currently no API to control creation or deletion of FusionAuth Cloud deployments. You can, however, use API keys to control the configuration and behavior of FusionAuth deployment within the cloud.

You cannot change any of the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[configuration options] that tweak system settings. If you feel you need to change any of these please open a https://account.fusionauth.io/account/support/[support ticket].

You cannot downgrade a FusionAuth Cloud deployment.

You cannot reuse urls. Once an deployment has been created and then destroyed, that url is reserved and cannot be reused.
