The RAM required by Elasticsearch depends on your login volume and user/entity counts. If you expect to have a few logins per minute and only a few thousand users/entities, `1GB-2GB` of RAM will be sufficient. If you have hundreds of millions of users/entities and 1,000 logins per second, you'll might need `256GB` of RAM. We recommend running load tests of FusionAuth to help determine the amount of RAM that is required for your needs.
