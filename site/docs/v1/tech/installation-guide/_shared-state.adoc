FusionAuth stores almost all state in its database. For clustered environments, the following interactions may occur between nodes:

* Cache invalidations.
* When an admin navigates to [breadcrumb]#System -> Log# and the logs are viewed or downloaded, each node may recieve a log retrieval request.

There may be future features implemented relying on interactions between nodes. These may not be documented if used for system internals.
