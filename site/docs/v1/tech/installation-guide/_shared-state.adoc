FusionAuth stores almost all state in its database. For clustered environments, the following interactions occur between nodes:

* Cache invalidations.
* When an admin navigates to [breadcrumb]#System -> Log# and the logs are viewed or downloaded, the list of nodes is used to identify which nodes we can access and request logs from.
* Future usage. These may not be documented since they may be for internal purposes.
