FusionAuth stores almost all state in its database. For clustered environments, the following interactions may occur between nodes:

* Cache invalidations.
* When an admin navigates to [breadcrumb]#System -> Log# and the logs are viewed or downloaded, each node may recieve a log retrieval request.

FusionAuth expects to communicate with other nodes in a cluster using `fusionauth-app.url` value, either as configured or automatically assigned. This can be TLS traffic or, if you are running FusionAuth on a private backplane, HTTP. If using TLS, the certificates must be valid, so if you are using self-signed certificates, add them to the Java trust store.

There may be future features implemented relying on interactions between nodes. These may not be documented if used for system internals.
