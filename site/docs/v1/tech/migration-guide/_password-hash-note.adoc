[NOTE]
====
During this migration, passwords are never exposed in plaintext. Neither FusionAuth, Auth0, nor you ever have access to the password.
====

However, once you've exported the password hashes from Auth0 and imported them into FusionAuth, your users will be able to log in to FusionAuth with the same password they used previously.
