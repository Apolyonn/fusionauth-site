At a minimum, assign your users to the appropriate migrated FusionAuth applications. You can do this in two ways:

* As part of your import script by modifying the script and adding link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users/#import-users[Registration JSON information] to the `map_user` method, as illustrated in <<Enhancing the Script>>.
* After users have been migrated with the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations/[Registrations API].

You'll also need to modify and test your applications to ensure:

* Users can log in.
* The authorization code redirect is handled correctly.
* Users receive appropriate permissions and roles.

If your application uses a standard OAuth, SAML or OIDC library to communicate with {migration_source_name}, the transition should be relatively painless.
