You now have your users migrated. Congratulations! What is next?

You need to migrate the other configuration, as mentioned in <<Other Entities>>. Make sure you assign your users to the appropriate FusionAuth applications. You can do this either by:

* As part of your import script by providing the registrations in the user loading script.
* After users have been migrated with the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations/[Registrations API]. This gives you more flexibility than the import script.

You'll also need to modify and test each of your applications, whether custom, open source, or commercial, to ensure:

* Users can successfully log in.
* The authorization code redirect is handled correctly.
* Users receive appropriate permissions and roles based on the JWT.
* The look and feel of the hosted login pages matches the application look and feel.

If your application uses a standard OAuth, SAML or OIDC library to communicate with {migration_source_name}, the transition should be relatively painless.
