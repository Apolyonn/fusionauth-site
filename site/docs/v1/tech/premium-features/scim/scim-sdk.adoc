:sectnumlevels: 0

== Overview

This document explains how to build a SCIM client using the open source https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK[SCIM-SDK Java Library] and use it with FusionAuth.

== Prerequisites

You'll need to have FusionAuth installed. link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[Learn more about various ways of installing it].

Ensure you have a license. You can link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/licensing[learn more about licensing here]. SCIM requires an enterprise license. Learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/editions-features[license options here] and link:/pricing[pricing here].

You'll need maven 3 and a modern version of Java installed. This document has been tested with Java 17.

You'll also need git installed.

== FusionAuth Configuration

In order for FusionAuth to accept requests from SCIM clients, you need to configure a few things.

=== Set Up Entity Types and Entities

Then, you need to review the required entity types.

These entity types will be present if you installed FusionAuth normally. However, they will not be present if you have used link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart[Kickstart].

If these entity types are present, you can skip to <<Set Up the Entities>>.

=== Add the Server Entity Type

First, add the SCIM server. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Entity Management -> Entity Types#. 

Select the [breadcrumb]#Add SCIM Server# option.

image::premium-features/scim/add-scim-server-entity-type.png[Add the SCIM server entity type.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

This entity will have the following default permissions:

* `scim:enterprise:user:create`
* `scim:enterprise:user:delete`
* `scim:enterprise:user:read`
* `scim:enterprise:user:update`
* `scim:group:create`
* `scim:group:delete`
* `scim:group:read`
* `scim:group:update`
* `scim:user:create`
* `scim:user:delete`
* `scim:user:read`
* `scim:user:update`

You can remove permissions if you never want your SCIM server to be able to undertake an operation. For example, remove `scim:user:delete` if you will never delete users from this SCIM server. Set the name to any appropriate value.

image::premium-features/scim/adding-scim-server-entity-type-details.png[The details page when adding add the SCIM server entity type.,width=1200]

=== Add the Client Entity Type

Then, create a SCIM client entity type. Unlike the server, this entity type doesn't require any permissions. Instead, this is the type for SCIM client applications. These applications will provide user and group data to the SCIM server for provisioning.

image::premium-features/scim/add-scim-client-entity-type.png[Adding the SCIM client entity type.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You can name the client entity type as you wish.

image::premium-features/scim/adding-scim-client-entity-type-details.png[The details of the SCIM client entity type.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After you have set up or verified the existence of these two types of entities, the next step is to set up the individual entities, representing the actual SCIM server or client applications.

=== Set Up the Entities

Next, set up at least two entities. You need to set up an instance of the SCIM server and the SCIM client, and then grant permissions on the SCIM server to the SCIM client.

You can have as many SCIM clients and servers as you would like, but in general you want at most one SCIM server per tenant. For each SCIM interaction, only one server can be specified.

To add the entities, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Entity Management -> Entities#. Create a new entity.

image::premium-features/scim/add-scim-server-entity.png[Adding a SCIM server entity.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Ensure it has the type of the SCIM server entity type detailed above. You can also give it a name.

image::premium-features/scim/adding-scim-server-entity-details.png[The details of the SCIM server entity.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After you save the entity, you'll be presented with the list of entities. Next, add another entity, for the SCIM client.

image::premium-features/scim/add-scim-client-entity.png[Adding a SCIM client entity.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Make sure it has the type of the SCIM client entity type detailed above. Give it a descriptive name as well.

image::premium-features/scim/adding-scim-client-entity-details.png[The details of the SCIM client entity.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Next, you need to manage the client entity in order to add permissions to access the server entity.

image::premium-features/scim/list-view-highlight-manage-button.png[The manage button on the SCIM client.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Click the "Add" button to begin the grant adding process.

image::premium-features/scim/client-grant-add-page.png[The "Add" Button lets you add grants.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Search for the SCIM server by entering the name of the entity in the search box and select the correct entity.

image::premium-features/scim/client-grant-search-page.png[Searching for the correct entity.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Next, add the permissions. You may grant one or more SCIM permissions to the client.

These will be provided during the SCIM process to authenticate the appropriate level of access. Select the SCIM server entity in the [field]#Name# field and any permissions you'd like this client to have. Below, the ability to read and create users is granted, but the client may neither delete nor update users.

image::premium-features/scim/granting-scim-client-permissions-on-scim-server.png[Granting permissions on the server to the client.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Finally, note the client Id of the SCIM server and the client Id and secret of the SCIM client. You can see the Ids by looking in the list view.

image::premium-features/scim/getting-ids-for-scim-client-and-server.png[Finding the Ids for the entities.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

To find the client secret, review details of the SCIM client entity. Navigate to the details screen by clicking on the "View" button (the magnifying glass) from the list screen.

image::premium-features/scim/scim-client-id-secret.png[Determining the client secret for the SCIM client.,width=1200]

You'll need these values to configure the application acting as a SCIM client. You'll learn more about this application below.

=== Set Up the Request and Response Lambdas

Next, we need to review the lambdas. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Lambdas#. You should see four lambdas labeled with "SCIM".

There are two sets of default lambdas, one for users and one for groups. Each set of lambdas has one lambda for incoming requests and the other for outgoing responses. You can use the same lambda for both User and EnterpriseUser resources, or you can use different ones.

Lambdas can transform requests and responses, register users for applications, make HTTP requests to external APIs, and contain other business logic. link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/[Learn more about the different lambdas], including their arguments.

image::premium-features/scim/scim-lambdas-list.png[The default SCIM lambdas.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

You may edit and modify lambdas as needed, but for the purposes of this document, the default lambdas are fine.

image::premium-features/scim/scim-user-request-default-lambda.png[The default SCIM user request lambda.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

After you have verified the lambdas will work for your needs, you should enable and configure SCIM at the tenant level.

=== Set Up the Tenant

Finally, you have configured the needed scaffolding to enable SCIM for a given tenant. 

To do so, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Default Tenant#. Edit the tenant and then navigate to the [breadcrumb]#SCIM# tab. Once you've checked the [field]#Enabled# field, you'll see the SCIM settings.

Configure the following details:

* The [field]#Client entity type# should be the client entity type you previously created: `SCIM Client`.
* The [field]#Server entity type# should be the client entity type you previously created: `SCIM Server`.
* The [field]#User request lambda# should be the default lambda.
* The [field]#User response lambda# should be the default lambda.
* The [field]#Enterprise User request lambda# should be the default lambda.
* The [field]#Enterprise User response lambda# should be the default lambda.
* The [field]#Group request lambda# should be the default lambda.
* The [field]#Group response lambda# should be the default lambda.

You can leave the [field]#Schemas# field blank, and a default schema will be provided.

Each of these settings is documented further. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#scim[Review detailed documentation about the various Tenant settings]. 

== The SCIM Client Application

Next,you will  create a small command line Java application as a SCIM client. This application will use the open source https://github.com/Captain-P-Goldfish/SCIM-SDK[SCIM-SDK Java library] to interact with the FusionAuth SCIM server. 

Recall that clients are the source of user information, so this client will be able to create, list and retrieve a user in FusionAuth. While this is a subset of typical usage, it suffices to demonstrate the integration.

The https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration[entire source code is available] and you should start by cloning it. Below you'll configure and run it.

Before you configure the application, clone the repository and compile it:

[source,shell,title=Setting up the example application]
----
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration && \
cd fusionauth-example-scim-integration && \
mvn compile
----

=== Configure the Application

You'll need to modify the application by editing `src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/scim/ScimExample.java` using the text editor or IDE of your choice. Search for the text: `change these`. You'll see something similar to:

[source,java,title="Configuration to change for the example"]
----
//...
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/scim/ScimExample.java[tags=scimConfiguration]
//...
----

Update the `FUSIONAUTH_HOST` constant with the URL pointing to your FusionAuth installation, such as `\http://localhost:9011`.

Update the `SCIM_SERVER_ENTITY_ID` constant with the Id of the entity with the type `SCIM Server` created above. This represents the FusionAuth server. If you didn't record this, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Entity Management -> Entities# and copy the Id from the list of entities. Also update the `CLIENT_ID` constant with the Id of the entity with the type `SCIM Client` created above. This will represent this java program. If you didn't record this, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Entity Management -> Entities# and copy the Id from the list of entities.

image::premium-features/scim/getting-ids-for-scim-client-and-server.png[Finding the Ids for the entities.,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Optionally update the `EXISTING_USER_ID` constant with the Id of any user in your system. You can find one by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Users# and viewing the details of a user. If you don't do this, you won't be able to retrieve a user.

Optionally update the `CREATED_USER_LOGIN_ID` constant with a unique username for your system. This will be the username of the created user. If you don't modify this value, the default username will be used.

The other constants may be left unchanged, unless you want to experiment with changing permissions or setting a different password for created users.

=== Run the Application

The application can be run in one of three modes:

* `get` which retrieves a single user
* `list` which lists users 
* `create`, which adds a new user

Let's create a new user and then check to see that the user was added.

To run the program, you need to recompile it after making the changes mentioned above:

[source,shell,title=Recompiling the sample application]
----
mvn compile
----

Then, you can run it. You need to provide two arguments to the application. The first is the client secret for the SCIM client entity. This value, along with the configured client Id, will be used to authenticate the SCIM client before the SCIM APIs are called. If you didn't record this, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Entity Management -> Entities#, view the details of the SCIM Client entity, and copy the secret.

Then, run the command below, with the value of `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` updated to the real value, such as `i2kN2KFBPKKj3FsxfilPXDDreBUskn2Sl-27QbQRYQM`.

[source,shell,title=Running the sample application]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="io.fusionauth.example.scim.ScimExample" \
-Dexec.args="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET create"
----

You'll see the output of the sample application, which should look something like this:

TODO why is this an error message? some kind of mapping issue. May need to tweak the response lambda

If you navigate to [breadcrumb]#Users# in the administrative user interface, you will see the new user has been added.

=== Examine the Application

Let's look at two sections of the example application. The first is the SCIM client authentication and the second is the method that creates the user.

To authenticate a SCIM client in FusionAuth, the client credentials grant is performed, including requesting any needed SCIM permissions. The resulting access token is then used as a bearer token in the SCIM API request, by including it in the `Authorization` header. This is all encapsulated in the `getCredentials` method:

[source,java,title="The getCredentials method"]
----
//...
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/scim/ScimExample.java[tags=getCredentials]
//...
----

The `create` operation first builds a user object and then calls the SDK provided `scimRequestBuilder.create` method, which posts to the FusionAuth server.

[source,java,title="The createUser method"]
----
//...
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration/main/src/main/java/io/fusionauth/example/scim/ScimExample.java[tags=createUser]
//...
----

The list and get operations of this client application similarly build the request and then use the SDK to make a SCIM compliant request. You can view, download and run the client application by cloning the https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-scim-integration[GitHub repository].

You've created a SCIM server and SCIM client that can provision users with SCIM into your FusionAuth instance.
