== Self Service For Users

FusionAuth Self Service Registration Forms automates many user facing tasks.  Below we will document two common tasks users of most applications will want to perform (at some point).

* <<User Profile Data (User Facing)>>
* <<Update User Password (User Facing)>>

=== User Profile Data (User Facing)

To edit profile data on the user, navigate to account self service home and click on the edit icon in the top right.

Once on the account self service edit screen your user object can be updated directly.

Any changes here will be saved to your user in FusionAuth.

=== Update User Password (User Facing)

To edit profile data (including the password) on the user, navigate to account self service home and click on the edit icon in the top right.

To update our password, toggle `Change Password` and you will be presented with a password entry and confirmation field.

Enter a new password, the confirmation of that new password and click `submit`.
