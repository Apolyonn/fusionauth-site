== Customizing Account Management

FusionAuth ships with a default template for the Account Management page. However, you are not limited to the default form fields or the theme for that matter. Below we will walk you through updating both.

=== Add a Form Field

To change a form:

1. Navigate to `icon:check-square[type=fas] Forms`
2. Click the icon:edit[type=fas ,role=ui-button blue] edit button on `Default User Self Service provided by FusionAuth`

==== Edit Form

Below is a quick refresher of what is available to you here.

In this example, we are going to add a `birthDate` field on our account management self service form. FusionAuth allows great flexibility in adding whatever field needed for self service administration.

More information can be found in our link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/advanced-registration-forms/[Advanced Registration Forms] page.

=== Form Fields
[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
A unique UUID is Auto generated if left blank.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
For display only. Name of the messenger.

[field]#Type# [optional]#Optional#::
This is read only.

Optionally, move each field around with `icon:arrow-up[type=fas] up` and `icon:arrow-down[type=fas] down` arrows as well as `icon:plus[type=fas] Add field` and `icon:plus[type=fas] Add section`


==== Adding Birthday

To add a `birthDate`, click `icon:plus[type=fas] Add field`

image::account-management/add-field-popup-birthdate.png[Form Home, width=600, role=bottom-cropped top-cropped box-shadow]

Select `Birthdate` and `icon:save[type=fas] Submit`. Now we have a custom form available on our self-service account management page.

Let's take a look. Navigate to --

- Your account management page,
- Login as a user of this application
- Click on the `icon:pencil[type=fas] icon` in the top right.

icon:trophy[] Success! Now we have a user with an editable `birthDate` field.

This is as simple example, but with FusionAuth forms you have the ability to create extend this account mangement form to whatever your business requirements demand.

=== Change Themes

[NOTE]
====
For more information on themes reference the documentation found link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[here].
====

What if we want to update the theme of our account page?  Adjusting is simple:

1. Make a copy of the default theme (or create your own) by navigating to `icon:paint-brush[type=fas] Themes > icon:copy[type=fas] duplication icon`
2. Click on the `icon:edit[type=fas] edit` button of the duplicated theme.

With account management, there are a number of prebuilt forms outlined below in red.

Let's update the Account Management index page with a `birthDate` field.

Click on the `Account index` FreeMarker template.  For this example, I have added simple text to the template.  Obviously, in a real world scenario, you would make more professional appearing changes.

Changes include
```html
<p>This is now modified with a birthdate field</p>
<dl class="horizontal">
<dt>${theme.message("user.birthDate")}</dt>
<dd>${helpers.display(user, "birthDate")}</dd>
</dl>
```

icon:trophy[] Success!  We now have an updated `Account index` page.
