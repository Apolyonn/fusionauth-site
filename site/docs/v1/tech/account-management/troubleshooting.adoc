== Troubleshooting

Not able to get your account management page up and running?  Below are two common warnings and how to fix them.

* <<Not Registered>>
* <<Registered But Configuration Needed>>

=== Not Registered

Please note, if the user is not registered to the application, they will not be able to manage their account information from these pages.

To fix this, navigate to:

From the Admin UI click on [breadcrumb]#Users -> Manage -> Registrations Tab# -> Add registration -> Add User#.  Another option is to programmatically add the user to the application through the API.

=== Registered But Configuration Needed

If you see this, you have to select a form to use.
