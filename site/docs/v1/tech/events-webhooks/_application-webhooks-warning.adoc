A few events can be generated for one or more specified applications, or for all applications within a tenant.

[WARNING]
====
The ability to limit the generation of an event for only certain applications is legacy functionality and will be modified in the future. If you want to get events for certain applications, send events for a tenant. Filter on the `applicationId` when consuming the event and discard events from any applications not of interest.
====

These events can be application scoped:

* `jwt.public-key.update`
* `jwt.refresh-token.revoke`
* `user.action`
