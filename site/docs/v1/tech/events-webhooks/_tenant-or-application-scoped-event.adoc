This is a tenant or application scoped event. It can be sent to all applications in a tenant or to one or more specified applications. It will also be sent to all tenants that are listening for this event. A [field]#tenantId# will be present in the payload to allow for filtering.

The ability to limit the generation of an event for only certain applications is legacy functionality and may be modified in the future. You almost certainly want to enable this event at the tenant level and optionally filter on the [field]#applicationId# when consuming the event.
