This API is used to update an existing {capitalized_object_name}.

You must specify the Id of the {capitalized_object_name} you are updating on the URI. You must specify all of the properties of the {capitalized_object_name} when calling this API with the `PUT` HTTP method. This API doesn't merge the existing {capitalized_object_name} and your new data. It replaces the existing {capitalized_object_name} with your new data.

Utilize the `PATCH` HTTP method to send only the changes to merge into an existing {capitalized_object_name}.
