Because SCIM schemas are completely customizable, the SCIM response returned is generated from the result of the SCIM User object populated by your outgoing response lambda.

The following is an example of a typical SCIM User response body that your SCIM client might expect. However, your outgoing response lambda could generate a completely different SCIM schema is desired.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM User schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC here:
