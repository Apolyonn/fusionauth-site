Because SCIM schemas are completely customizable, the SCIM response returned is generated from the result of the SCIM {resource_type} object populated by your outgoing response lambda.

The following is an example of a typical SCIM {resource_type} response body that a SCIM client might expect. However, your outgoing response lambda could generate a completely different SCIM schema if desired.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM {resource_type} schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-{rfc_section}[here].
