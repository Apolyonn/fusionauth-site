Because SCIM schemas are completely customizable, There are no required fields for the incoming request other than the common fields that all SCIM requests must include to match the specification. The only requirement about the user data is that in the incoming request lambda, you must specify either the **email** or the **username** or both for the FusionAuth User object. Either of these values may be used to uniquely identify the User and may be used to authenticate the User. Otherwise, it is completely up to your defined lambda to match any other incoming user data to the appropriate FusionAuth User fields for your configuration.
