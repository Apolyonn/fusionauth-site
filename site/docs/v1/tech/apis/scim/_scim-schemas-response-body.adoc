Because the SCIM specification allows for customization of the schemas using extensions, there is no way to accurately document all the JSON structure possibilities.

The following is the default response body. However, you can customize this response by modifying the schemas setting link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#scim[here].

This is taken from the SCIM RFC describing a SCIM Schemas schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-7[here].
