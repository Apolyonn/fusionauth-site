Because SCIM schemas are completely customizable, there are no required fields for the incoming request other than the common fields that all SCIM requests must include to match the specification.

The following is an example of a typical SCIM {resource_type} request body a SCIM client might send. However, your incoming request lambda could use these values in completely different ways to populate the FusionAuth {fusionauth_type} object if you choose.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM Group schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-{rfc_section}[here].
