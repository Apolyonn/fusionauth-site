[field]#active# [type]#[Boolean]# [required]#Required#::
The state of the SCIM Resource.

[field]#schemas# [type]#[Array]# [required]#Required#::
The String identifier of the SCIM Resource schemas and extensions provided in the request. This should match supported schemas and extensions for the provisioning server.

[field]#externalId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#::
The externalId is a unique identifier created by the client that identifies the resource in the SCIM client's environment. It could be used as the FusionAuth resource id as well, but that is not a requirement of the SCIM specification. That would need to be done by the defined incoming lambda if desired.
