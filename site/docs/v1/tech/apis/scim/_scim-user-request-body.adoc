The following is an example of a typical SCIM User create request body a SCIM client might send. However, your incoming request lambda could use these values in completely different ways to populate the FusionAuth User object if you choose.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM User schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#4.1[here].
