====
Where my field definitions at!?!

Because the SCIM specification allows for customization of the schemas using extensions, there is no way to accurately document all the JSON structure possibilities.
====

The following is the default response body. However, you can customize the schemas portion of the response by modifying the schemas setting link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#scim[here].

This is taken from the SCIM RFC describing a SCIM ResourceTypes schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-6[here].
