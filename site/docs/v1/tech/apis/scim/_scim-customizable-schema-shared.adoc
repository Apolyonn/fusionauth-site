include::_scim-fields-note.adoc[]

The following is just an example of a typical SCIM {resource_type} {action} body a SCIM client might send. However, your incoming request link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/{lambda_file_name}[lambda] must map these values to populate the FusionAuth {fusionauth_type}. A default link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/{lambda_file_name}[lambda] is provided for you that would handle a {action} like this example.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM {resource_type} schema. For the full specification you can find the link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-{rfc_section}[RFC].
