[NOTE]
====
Where my field definitions at!?!

Because the SCIM specification allows for almost limitless customization of the schemas using extensions, there is no way to accurately document all the json structure possibilities.

The following is just an example of a typical SCIM {resource_type} {action} body a SCIM client might send. However, your incoming request link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/{lambda_file_name}[lambda] must map these values to populate the FusionAuth {fusionauth_type}. A default link:/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/{lambda_file_name}[lambda] is provided for you that would handle a {action} like this example.

This is taken from the SCIM Schema RFC describing a SCIM {resource_type} schema. For the full specification you can find the RFC link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-{rfc_section}[here].
