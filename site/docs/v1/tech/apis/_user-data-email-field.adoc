If user `richard` has a [field]#user.data.email# with a value of `dinesh@fusionauth.io`, whoever controls `dinesh@fusionauth.io` has elevated access to the `richard` account. That user can now reset the password on the `richard` account, for example.

Such functionality may be useful in certain circumstances. Be aware of the security ramifications before using this. This was removed in version 1.26.0 and added back in in 1.27.2.
