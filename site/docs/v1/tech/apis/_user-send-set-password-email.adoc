[field]#sendSetPasswordEmail# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#::
Indicates to FusionAuth to send the User an email asking them to set their password. This email is only sent on user creation. The Email Template that is used is configured in the Tenant [field]#Setup password# field.
+
If you set this value to `true` the `password` field is then ignored, FusionAuth will set the initial password to a securely generated random string.
+
If you have also enabled email verification and do not select to skip verification using the `skipVerification` parameter, only the setup password email will be sent to the user. Setting up the password using the email sent during this user create operation will implicitly verify the User's email if it is not already verified.
+
If the SMTP email configuration is not complete, or disabled, this value is ignored.
