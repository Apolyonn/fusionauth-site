Only the name of the Key may be changed; all other fields will remain the same. If you need to update a Key with a new certificate, algorithm or other attributes, please link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/keys#import-a-key[Import a Key].

For example, if you have a Key with an associated expiring certificate, you'll need to follow the steps similar to those outlined in the link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/key-rotation#jwt-signing-key-rotation[JWT signing key rotation documentation]:

* Import this key into FusionAuth.
* Update the appropriate configuration with this new Key (JWT signing configuration, SAML validation configuration, etc).
* Once the configured, remove the expired, previous Key. 

Note that validation rules will prevent you from removing an in-use key.
