This API is used to update the {object_name}. You must specify the Id of the {object_name} to update on the URI.

You must specify all of the properties of the {object_name} when calling this API with the `PUT` HTTP method. This API doesn't merge the existing {object_name} and your new data. It replaces the existing {object_name} with your new data. 

Utilize the `PATCH` HTTP method to send only the changes to merge into an existing {object_name}.
