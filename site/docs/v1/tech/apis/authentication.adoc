== Overview

The FusionAuth APIs are primarily secured using API keys, a few APIs may optionally take a JWT. Below you will find a detailed explanation of each type of authentication used in the API documentation.

* icon:lock[type=fas] &nbsp;<<API Key Authentication>>
* icon:lock[type=fas] &nbsp;<<Basic Authentication with API Key>>
* icon:id-badge[type=fas] &nbsp;<<JWT Authentication>>
* icon:unlock[type=fas] &nbsp;<<No Authentication Required>>

Prior to version 1.26.0, the FusionAuth administrative user interface was the only way to create API keys, this functionality was not available through an API.

Starting from version 1.26.0 API keys can be created using an API. Please refer to the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys#[API Key API].

To manage API keys navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys#.

Here's a brief video covering some aspects of API keys:

== API Key Authentication

When an API is marked with a red locked icon such as &nbsp;&nbsp;icon:lock[type=fas] it means you are required to provide authentication.
FusionAuth primarily controls access to the API through the use of an API key. All secured APIs by default all APIs will return an `401 Unauthorized` response.

To enable access to a secured API create one or more API keys in the FusionAuth user interface. The API key is then supplied in the HTTP
request using the Authorization header.  See <<Manage API Keys>> for more information on adding additional keys.

The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header with an API key of `2524a832-c1c6-4894-9125-41a9ea84e013`.

[NOTE]
====
This authentication method has been available since 1.26.0
====
== Basic Authentication with API Key
HTTP basic authentication is a simple, standards based, authentication method. A username and password are supplied, separated by a `:` and prefaced by `Basic`. The `username:password` string is base64 encoded.

Basic auth requires two pieces of information, username and password. In FusionAuth, to authenticate using the `Basic Auth` method, the username must be `apikey` (all lowercase) and the password must be any API key with the appropriate permission for the endpoint being called.

== JWT Authentication

When an API is marked with a blue identity icon such as &nbsp;icon:id-badge[title="Supports JWT",type=fas]&nbsp; it means you may call this API without
an API key but instead provide a JSON Web Token (JWT) pronounced "jot". These APIs may be called with a signed token in place of an API key. A JWT is
obtained from the Login API. The token will also be provided as an HTTP Only Session cookie. If cookies are being managed for you by the browser or some
other RESTful client, the JWT cookie will automatically be send to FusionAuth on your behalf and you may omit the `Authorization` header.

=== Authorization Header Examples

[.example]
--
The following example demonstrates the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer schema. Prior to version `1.12.0` only the JWT schema was available.
[source,properties]
----
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo

=== Cookie Example

If a cookie is provided on a request that accepts an API key or an JWT, the API key will be preferred.

[.example]
--
The following is an HTTP GET request with the JWT Access Token provided as a cookie.
[source,shell]
----
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Cookie: access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0ODUxNDA5ODQsImlhdCI6MTQ4NTEzNzM4NCwiaXNzIjoiYWNtZS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIyOWFjMGMxOC0wYjRhLTQyY2YtODJmYy0wM2Q1NzAzMThhMWQiLCJhcHBsaWNhdGlvbklkIjoiNzkxMDM3MzQtOTdhYi00ZDFhLWFmMzctZTAwNmQwNWQyOTUyIiwicm9sZXMiOltdfQ.Mp0Pcwsz5VECK11Kf2ZZNF_SMKu5CgBeLN9ZOP04kZo

== No Authentication Required

When an API that is marked with a green unlocked icon such as &nbsp;icon:unlock-alt[role=green, title="No authentication required",type=fas] it means that you are not
required to provide an `Authorization` header as part of the request. The API is either designed to be publicly accessible or the request may take a parameter that is itself secure.

== Manage API Keys

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> API Keys# to manage API keys.

Create as many API keys as you like, each one may be optionally limited in ability to minimize security risk.

For example, the User API `/api/user` has four HTTP methods, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. While each API may have different semantics, in a general sense you can think of these four HTTP methods as being retrieve, create, update and delete respectively. With that in mind, if you'd like to create an API key that can only retrieve users, you would limit the API key to the `GET` method on the `/api/user` API.

When you create an API key the key is defaulted to a secure random value but the API key is simply a string, so you may call it `super-secret-key` if you'd like. However a long and random value makes a good API key in that it is unique and difficult to guess.

=== Create an API Key

image::create-api-key.png[Create an API Key,width=1200]

==== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id#::
The unique Id of this API key

[field]#Key#::
A unique key to be utilized to authorize API requests using the `Authorization` header.

[field]#Description#::
An optional description of how this API key will be utilized.

[field]#Tenant#::
The optional tenant to which this API key will be assigned. This value cannot be changed once the API key is created. This field is only displayed when more than one tenant exists. When you assign an API key to a tenant, you will only be able to operate on users, applications, and groups in the selected tenant.

[field]#Endpoints#::
Select one or more endpoints this API key will be authorized to access. Selecting no endpoints will authorize this key to all API endpoints.

[field]#Key Manager#::
Toggle to set this key as a key manager. Setting this key as a key manager allows this key to be used to call link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys#[API keys APIs]. An attempt to call API Keys APIs with a non-manager key (`keyManager` set to `false`) will always return a HTTP response status code 401.
