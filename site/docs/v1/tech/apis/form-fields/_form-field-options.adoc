A list of options that are applied to `checkbox`, `radio`, or `select` controls.
+
You may localize the displayed values during registration by adding these values to your theme.
+
For example, if you specify the values `["red", "green", "blue"]` as the field options, these will be stored on the user in this lowercase form. By default the values `red`, `green` and `blue` will be rendered in the UI.
+
If you were to add the following messages to your theme, the capitalized form of the values will be shown to the end user. This allows you to provide a human readable form of the value and optionally localize the displayed values.
