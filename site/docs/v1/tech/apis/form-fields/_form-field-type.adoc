The data type used to store the value in FusionAuth. The possible values are:
+
 * `bool` the value must be a boolean value, `true` or `false`
 * `consent` the value will be used to complete self consent
 * `date` the value will be stored as a date
 * `email` the value will be expected to be a valid email address
 * `number` the value will be stored as a numerical value
 * `string` the value will be stored as a string
+
If the value provided by the user cannot be converted to the requested data type a validation error will occur.
+
When using the `date` type, the only supported data format is ISO-8601 or `YYY-MM-DD`. You may want to use a JavaScript data picker that can convert the selected value to this format.
+
When using the `consent` type, the field [field]#consentId# must be included in the request.
+
Defaults to `string`, unless `user.birthDate`, then `date`, or if `user.email` then `email`.
