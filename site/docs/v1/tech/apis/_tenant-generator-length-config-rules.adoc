If the [field]#{generator_type}.type# is equal to `randomAlpha` then the length must be greater or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 12. +
If the [field]#{generator_type}.type# is equal to `randomAlphaNumeric` then the length must be greater or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 12. +
If the [field]#{generator_type}.type# is equal to `randomBytes` then the length must be greater or equal to 16 and less than or equal to 128. +
If the [field]#{generator_type}.type# is equal to `randomDigits` then the length must be greater or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 12. +
