FusionAuth caches API keys for a faster lookup. There is an internal distributed cache and notification policy for multi-node deployments. When you create a new key, it will take time for the API key to be usable. Usually this less than one second. In rare cases where node communication fails, it may take up to 60 seconds.

This means that if you are creating a new API key using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys[API Key API] and then trying to use it, you may receive a 401 status code, indicating you didn't supply a valid API key.

The workaround to wait for a period, using exponential backoff and then retry the request.
