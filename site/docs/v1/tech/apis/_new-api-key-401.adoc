FusionAuth caches API keys for a faster lookup. There is an internal distributed cache and notification policy for multi-node deployments. When you create a new key, it will take a bit of time for the API key to be usable.

This means that if you are creating a new API key using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/api-keys[API Key API] and then trying to use it, you may receive a 401 status code, indicating you didn't supply a valid API key.

The workaround to wait for a period, using exponential backoff and then retry the request.
