Welcome! At the end of this guide, you will know how to add login (sign in) and logout (sign out) to a Node.js application, using Express and Pug.

FusionAuth is a standalone server. When your user tries to log in from your application, you'll send them to FusionAuth. FusionAuth will authenticate them and then send them back to your application, where they can use features that you write. This architecture has a number of benefits.

* FusionAuth is the only system that sees confidential credentials such as passwords.
* It is easy to have additional applications use the same authentication system.
* If you have (or add in the future) different needs around user login and registration, such as requiring multi-factor authentication, you can implement them in a central location.

FusionAuth is available both as an installable piece of software and a SaaS service, so you have options. The software functionality is the same no matter where you run it.

Once you have signed in and are at the admin dashboard, the rest of the instructions are the same.

One of FusionAuth's unique attributes is the variety of places you can install it. Bare metal, cloud, container: yup. Windows, macOS, Linux: sure! You can learn more about link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[different options in the installation guide].

Please pick the option below you want to use to explore FusionAuth.

* link:/docs/v1/tech/getting-started/5-minute-docker[Docker], which requires docker and docker compose. This is the best choice if you have docker and docker compose installed.
* link:/docs/v1/tech/getting-started/5-minute-fastpath[FastPath], which requires a local database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). This is the best option if you have a local database set up already.
* link:/docs/v1/tech/getting-started/5-minute-sandbox[The sandbox], which is a public shared location, with data regularly wiped. This is the best choice if you don't want to install anything and are okay with other's seeing your test users and other data.
