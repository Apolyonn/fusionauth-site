If you're looking for a provider that is not listed here, review the open features in https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub] and either vote or comment on an existing feature, or open a new feature request if you do not find an existing feature open.

Find the FusionAuth Identity Providers in the UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# or use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/[Identity Providers] APIs.

== Identity Providers and Applications

Identity providers can be enabled or disabled on a per application basis.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the Pied Piper application and enabled "Create registration". Enabling "Create registration" means that a user does not need to be manually registered for the application prior to using this login provider.

image::identity-providers/identity-provider-application-config.png[Identity Providers,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

For example, when a new user attempts to log into Pied Piper using Google, if their user does not exist in FusionAuth it will be created dynamically, and if the Create registration toggle has been enabled, the user will also be registered for Pied Piper and assigned any default roles assigned by the application.

If you do not wish to automatically provision a user for this Application when logging in with Google, leave Create registration off and you will need to manually register a user for this application before they may complete login with Google and be authorized for the Pied Piper Application.

[NOTE]
====
Regardless of whether you enable "Create registration" or not, a user may be created within FusionAuth when a person signs in with the identity provider. What happens depends on the configured linking strategy. This setting controls whether a user is registered and therefore authorized for this application.
====

When you enable an identity provider you're indicating that this external provider is an additional SoR (Source of Record). When the user successfully logs into this provider such as Google, Google has told FusionAuth the user exists and their credentials are valid. In return FusionAuth accepts this source of record and creates link and/or user, depending on the linking strategy. Next we identify if the configuration allows us to automatically register (that is, provide authorization) for the requested application, based on the "Create registration" setting.

== Overrides

For each application, you can provide different configuration. You might do this if you had two different FusionAuth applications that were both using Apple as an identity provider, but using different Apple configuration settings. You can override none, some or all of the configuration values by expanding the "Overrides" link for the given application assignment or modifying the [field]#identityProvider.applicationConfiguration# values using the API.

image::identity-providers/override-identity-provider-settings.png[Overriding Identity Provider settings,width=1200,role=top-cropped]

However, you cannot have two different identity provider configurations for the same FusionAuth application configuration. Use two different FusionAuth application configurations instead.

Additionally, override settings are not available in the External JWT, SAMLv2, or OpenID Connect Identity Providers. You can create multiple instances of these providers, which allows for different configuration.


== Hints

When you are using the FusionAuth hosted login pages, you can bypass the login page and go directly to a third party Identity Provider based upon the user's email address or an Identity Provider Id.

[NOTE]
====
Hints currently work with Google, Facebook, SAMLv2 and OpenID Connect Identity Providers. Please check this link:https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1306[issue] as support is added for other IdP types.
====

An Identity Provider Id is appended to the Login URL for an application using the `idp_hint` request parameter. For example, to send a user directly to a login page for an OIDC identity provider with the id `44449786-3dff-42a6-aac6-1f1ceecb6c46`, you'd append `&idp_hint=44449786-3dff-42a6-aac6-1f1ceecb6c46`.

An email address or domain may be provided in the `login_hint` request parameter, if the IdP is SAMLv2 or OpenID Connect. For example, to send a user directly to the login page of an OIDC IdP configured with a domain of `example.com`, you'd append `&login_hint=example.com` to the application's Login URL.

You can read more about the `login_hint` and `idp_hint` parameters in the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints/[OAuth Endpoints documentation].

== Linking Strategies

image::identity-providers/linking-strategy.png[Linking Strategies, role=top-cropped bottom-cropped, width=1200]

The linking strategy to use when creating the link between the Identity Provider and the user.

The possible values are:

* `Create a Pending Link` - Do not automatically link, instead return a pending link identifier that can be used to link to an existing user.
* `Anonymously Link` - Always create a link based upon the unique Id returned by the identity provider. A username or email is not required and will not be used to link the user. A reconcile lambda will not be used in this configuration.
* `Link On Email` - Link to an existing user based upon email. A user will be created with the email returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `Link On Email. Do not create the user if they do not exist` - Only link to an existing user based upon email. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with email returned by the identity provider.
* `Link On Username` - Link to an existing user based upon username. A user will be created with the username returned by the identity provider if one does not already exist.
* `Link On Username. Do not create the user if they do not exist` - Only link to an existing user based upon username. A user will not be created if one does not already exist with the username returned by the identity provider.

Here's a table illustrating the alternatives:

[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Strategy | User must exist in FusionAuth | User linked on | Use when the identity provider

| Create a Pending Link | Yes | Yes, user must login to existing account | Has a different email or username than an existing FusionAuth identity and users know enough to link them.
| Anonymously Link | No | IdP id | Exposes neither username nor email.
| Link On Email | No | Email address | Has the user's email and users that do not exist in the identity provider can have access.
| Link On Email. Do not create the user if they do not exist | Yes | Email address | Has the user's email and you don't want users that do not exist in the identity provider to have access.
| Link On Username | No | Username | Has the user's username and users that do not exist in the identity provider can have access.
| Link On Username. Do not create the user if they do not exist | Yes | Username | Has the user's username and you don't want users that do not exist in the identity provider to have access.
|===


Some identity providers don't provide a username and/or email.  In those instances, it is recommended to consider using a pending link or creating an anonymous link.  Both of these options enable you to link the user without an email/username in the response from the IdP.

== Linking and Create Registration

The [field]#Linking strategy# and [field]#Create registration# configurations are related to each other, but distinct. 
The [field]#Linking strategy# controls how a User is created in FusionAuth based on information returned from the remote identity provider. [field]#Create registration# controls if the User created in FusionAuth is registered for a given Application.

== Linking Examples

Here are some walkthroughs of linking scenarios. A user logs in to a remote Identity Provider when the FusionAuth hosted login pages are being used. Similar behavior is available via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/[Identity Provider API]. 

It doesn't matter if the Identity Provider is a social provider like Facebook or an enterprise provider like an OIDC or SAML compatible identity server.

==== Anonymous Account Limitations

Users with an anonymous account may log in to applications using their IdP provided credentials. They won't have an email address, so can't use any of the email based FusionAuth workflows like 'forgot password'. You also can't modify the user using any FusionAuth APIs. If you try to modify the user, you must provide a username or email.
