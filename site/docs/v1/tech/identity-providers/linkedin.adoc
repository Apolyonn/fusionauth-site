== Overview

Adding a Sign in with LinkedIn button to FusionAuth is simple, and this guide will walk you through the steps necessary to collect the credentials from LinkedIn in order to enable this Social login.

* <<Sign Up For LinkedIn and Log In>>
* <<Optionally Create a LinkedIn App>>
* <<Grant Your App Required Permissions>>
* <<Set Up Your LinkedIn App Client Credentials>>
* <<Create a LinkedIn Identity Provider>>

Once you have completed this configuration you will be able to enable the LinkedIn login button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. Below is an example login page with the LinkedIn Identity Provider enabled.

== Sign Up For LinkedIn and Log In

You must have a LinkedIn account for this Integration.

Ensure you have a LinkedIn account by registering for one.

Log in to LinkedIn and navigate to the https://www.linkedin.com/developers/[developer portal].

== Optionally Create a LinkedIn App

If you have an existing LinkedIn app which you are going to use, skip this step.

If you don't have an existing LinkedIn app, navigate to the https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps/new[new application form] and fill out the form. In the following example I will need to create my first application before I can create credentials. I will call the application `Pied Piper`.

== Grant Your App Required Permissions

In the LinkedIn developer portal, ensure you are viewing the correct LinkedIn application by navigating to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application#. 

If you don't see the [breadcrumb]#Products# tab for your application, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Products# in the top level menu. This may occur if this is your first LinkedIn application.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application -> Products#. Select `Sign In With LinkedIn` and accept the terms.

== Set Up Your LinkedIn App Client Credentials

In the LinkedIn developer portal, ensure you are viewing the correct LinkedIn app by navigating to [breadcrumb]#My apps -> Your Application#.

View the application credentials by going to [breadcrumb]#Auth -> Application credentials#. Record both the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` values.

Add your redirect URL. This value will be your FusionAuth installation hostname with the string `/oauth2/callback` appended. 

For example, if you are going to access FusionAuth at `https://login.piedpiper.com` then you will need to add `https://login.piedpiper.com/oauth2/callback` to the `Authorized redirect URLs for your app` setting. Save the setting.

You should see the following scopes in the [breadcrumb]#Oauth 2.0 Scopes# section:

* `r_emailaddress`
* `r_liteprofile`

[NOTE]
====
If you do not see these scopes, you may not have added the LinkedIn product to your LinkedIn app correctly. You may also need to reload the app page or log out of LinkedIn and log in again to make sure your application has the proper settings. 
====

Now you have completed creating a LinkedIn App with the appropriate permissions. 

== Create a LinkedIn Identity Provider

The last step will be to create a LinkedIn Identity Provider in FusionAuth. Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Create an Identity Provider by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `LinkedIn` from the dialog.

This will take you to the `Add LinkedIn` panel, and you'll fill out the `Client Id` and `Client secret` required fields with the values previously recorded. The button text is also required but it will be defaulted to `Sign in with LinkedIn`. You may optionally modify this value.

To enable this identity provider for an application, find your application name in the `Applications` configuration section at the bottom of this panel. You will always see the `FusionAuth` application, this application represents the FusionAuth administrative user interface. If you wish to be able to log into FusionAuth with this provider, you may enable this application.

In the following screenshot you will see that we have enabled this login provider for the `Pied Piper` application and enabled `Create registration`. Enabling create registration means that a user does not need to be manually registered for the application prior to using this login provider.

For example, when a new user attempts to log into `Pied Piper` using LinkedIn, if their user does not exist in FusionAuth it will be created dynamically, and if the `Create registration` toggle has been enabled, the user will also be registered for `Pied Piper` and assigned any default roles assigned by the application.

If you do not wish to automatically provision a user for this Application when logging in with LinkedIn, leave `Create registration` off. You will need to manually register a user for this application before they may `Sign in with LinkedIn`.

That's it, now the `Sign in with LinkedIn` button will show up on the login page for the Pied Piper application.
