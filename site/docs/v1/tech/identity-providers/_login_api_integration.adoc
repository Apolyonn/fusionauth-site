If you are building your own login experience, you'll want to start the identity provider flow yourself and then complete the login. 

You might do this if you are using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/login[Login API] rather than using the hosted FusionAuth login pages.

Completing the login is link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/identity-providers/{identity_provider}#complete-the-{identity_provider}-login[documented further in the API].
