When you first add an MFA method to a user, the response is a set of codes:

[source,json]
.Recovery Codes Response JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/two-factor/response-with-recovery-codes.json[]
----

These should be presented to the user for them to store off. They are one time use. As a developer, you can manage them via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/two-factor/#retrieve-recovery-codes[Recovery Code API] as well.

These recovery codes may be used any time a `code` parameter is required in an MFA flow. If valid, FusionAuth considers the additional factor provided and marks the code as used. 

These recovery codes are useful if a user loses their device or access to their email account. By saving these off someplace else, the user can still access their account even if they've lost access to their MFA method of choice.
