MFA methods can be migrated between systems if needed.

By using the link: Users API and the MFA attributes of the user, you can migrate over MFA of any of the supported methods.

You must create the appropriate value for the [field]#twoFactor# field.

Here are some examples

user.twoFactor.methods[x].method [String] Optional`

If your MFA method is not supported, but is message based (such as push notifications) please evalute the link:/docs/v1/tech/messengers/generic-messenger[Generic Messenger] to see if it fits your needs.

Otherwise, please open a github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-issues/issues[GitHub issue] detailing your use case.
