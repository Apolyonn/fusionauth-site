== Overview

A vital part of registration is validating a user's email address, as well as being able to send password reset emails, or critical account information.

* <<Configuring Registration Verification Settings>>
* <<View a Verified User>>


== Configure the Tenant Email Server

To send emails, you will need to configure SMTP email server credentials for your tenant. Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant# and then select the [breadcrumb]#Email# tab. Scroll to the [breadcrumb]#SMTP settings# section. Configure this with your SMTP server information. If you are testing locally, you can use a mock email server like https://mailcatcher.me/[MailCatcher].

Ensure a test email is delivered. If you have any issues, follow the steps in the link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/troubleshooting#troubleshooting-email[email troubleshooting documentation].

Save the configuration.


== Configuring Registration Verification Settings

You can configure additional settings around registration verification in the application you setup for registrations. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Your Application# and then select the [breadcrumb]#Registration# tab. Scroll up to the [breadcrumb]#Registration Verification Settings# section, just above the "Registration Fields" section.

Here you can specify if a registration verification email should be sent to the user. Toggling the "Verify registrations" switch on will reveal some further options.

You can choose the email template to send for registration verification. Choose the "Email Verification" template.

For the "Verification Strategy" option, you can choose to send a link in the verification email to the user, or to send a short code that they can type in the registration form to verify their account.

If you choose to send a short code, you must also set the "Unverified behaviour" option to "Gated". Note that the "Gated" behaviour option, and thus the short code option, is only available with a valid license key. Please visit link:/pricing[our pricing page] to review paid edition options and buy a license.

Your verification settings should now look like this:

Save all changes to the application.

== View a Verified User

After a user verifies their email address, if you navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Users# and then user details by clicking the "Manage User" button to the right of the list entry. There will now be a green checkmark next to the user's email address, indicating that the user has been verified.
