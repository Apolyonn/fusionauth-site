== Overview

Generic Connectors allow you to authenticate users against or migrate them from any user datasource accessible over HTTP or TLS.

To use a Generic Connector:

* Build a Generic Connector API endpoint in your application to expose your user data.
* Configure the Connector in [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Connectors#, including securing the endpoint.
* Add the Connector Policy in [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Connectors# to configure to which domains the connector applies.

=== Request

The request to your API endpoint will be delivered as JSON:

[source,json]
.Example Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/login/request.json[]
----

Your application will then look up the user and verify the correct credentials were provided. Then you can return the response.

=== Response

Your API should return a valid FusionAuth `user` object with status code 200 if the user is found and authenticated. Note that while you may return any of the attributes of the user object, only the required ones must be returned.

If the user cannot be authenticated, you should return the appropriate status code and response data as documented by the link:../apis/login[Login API].
