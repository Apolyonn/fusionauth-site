To use a Generic Connector:

* Build a Generic Connector API endpoint in your application which exposes your user data.
* Configure the Connector in [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Connectors#, including securing the endpoint.
* Add the Connector Policy in [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Connectors# to configure to which users the connector applies.
