== Overview

LDAP Connectors allow you to authenticate users against or migrate them from any user datasource which is accessible over HTTP.

To use a LDAP Connector:

* Ensure your LDAP server is accessible to the FusionAuth instance. This may entail locating FusionAuth in the correct network or configuring a firewall to allow access.
* Optionally create an LDAP entry for FusionAuth to connect with.
* Create an link:../lambdas/ldap-connector-reconcile[LDAP reconcile Lambda].
* Configure the Connector in [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Connectors#.
** The LDAP URL and connection security
** The previously created lambda
** LDAP directory settings: the base structure, account to connect as, mapping of attributes
* Add the Connector Policy in [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant -> Connectors# to configure to which domains the connector applies.

=== LDAP Directory Settings

These help map the data from LDAP directory to FusionAuth. 

==== Base structure

Where in the directory to start your search. To search the entire directory: `DC=piedpiper,DC=com`. If you want to search against only engineering: `OU=engineering,DC=piedpiper,DC=com`.

==== System account DN

The distinguished name of an entry which has read access to the directory. For example: `CN=ReadOnlyFusionAuthUser,OU=engineering,DC=piedpiper,DC=com`.

==== System account password

The password of the entry with read access.

==== Login identifier attribute

The value that the user would enter for their username on a login screen. For example: `uid` or `userPrincipalName`.

==== Identifying attribute

The entry attribute name which is the first component of the distinguished name of entries in the directory. For example: `cn`.

==== Requested attributes

The list of requested directory attributes to be returned. These will be passed to the lambda to be converted into FusionAuth user attributes. For example: `cn givenName sn userPrincipalName mail`

=== Security

You can connect via either LDAPS or StartTLS. 

You may also use an unencrypted connection, which is not recommended unless you use an alternative method of securing your connection, such as a VPN.
