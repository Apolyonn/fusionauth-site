== Overview

FusionAuth is single tenant SaaS or downloadable solution.

This means that you control when upgrades occur, rather than having an upgrade forced on you.

[NOTE.note]
====
Authentication and authorization are core dependencies of your application, and we hate forced dependency upgrades.

You control when you change versions.
====

There are a number of ways to be updated when a new version of FusionAuth is released, please pick the one that works best for you.
