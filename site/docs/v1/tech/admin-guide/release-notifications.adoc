description: How can you see when a new version of FusionAuth is released?

== Overview

FusionAuth is a single tenant SaaS or downloadable solution. This fact means that you control when upgrades occur, rather than having an upgrade with new functionality and possibly breaking changes forced on you and your team.

[NOTE.note]
====
Authentication and authorization are core dependencies of your application, and we hate forced dependency upgrades.

You and you alone control when you upgrade.
