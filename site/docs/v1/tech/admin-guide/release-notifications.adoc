== Overview

FusionAuth is single tenant SaaS or downloadable solution.

This means that you control when upgrades occur, rather than having an upgrade forced on you. Authentication and authorization are core dependencies of your application, and we hate forced dependency upgrades.

There are a number of ways to be updated when a new version of FusionAuth is released, please pick the one that works best for you.
