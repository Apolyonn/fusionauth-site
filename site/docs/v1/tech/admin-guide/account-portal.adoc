== Overview

The account portal is where you can manage your account data, deployments and licenses.
The portal is distinct from your FusionAuth instance, which is where your user data lives.
While an instance can be self-hosted or hosted in FusionAuth cloud, the account portal is a internet accessible web application.

You can control all aspects by logging into the link:https://account.fusionauth.io/[account portal, window="_blank"].

=== Portal Areas

Your account portal contains the following areas:

* [breadcrumb]#Home# - displays the dashboard, giving you an overview of everything in your account.
* [breadcrumb]#Plan# - select or modify the account's FusionAuth plan (also known as an edition). More details on the link:/pricing[plan differences here]. This is also where you will find your license keys when you are not using the Community edition.
* [breadcrumb]#Deployments# - configure and manage FusionAuth Cloud deployments. link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/cloud[Learn more about deployments].
* [breadcrumb]#Users# - add and remove users from the account portal. Any user added may have one of many roles. 
* [breadcrumb]#Billing# - add or update your billing information.
* [breadcrumb]#Company# - add or update your company information.
* [breadcrumb]#Support# - learn more about support options or open a support ticket. link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/technical-support[Learn more about technical support].
* [breadcrumb]#Account# - manage your user account, including adding MFA or changing your password.
* [breadcrumb]#Logout# - logs you out of the application.

After you register, you'll be taken to the [breadcrumb]#Home# tab.
You can choose a plan, price out a deployment, or add your billing information.
You'll need to provide that before you can create a deployment.
However, you can fully price out a deployment before entering billing information.

You can navigate away from the [breadcrumb]#Home# tab and explore other areas of the account portal.
For example, you can add other users, update your information, or change your company name.
