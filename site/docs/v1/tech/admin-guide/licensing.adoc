== Introduction

include::docs/v1/tech/shared/_licensing-premium-features-intro.adoc[]

You can see a list of features on the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/premium-features[premium features page].

== Adding Your License to Your Instance

To access paid features, purchase a license via the link:/pricing[pricing page] or by link:/contact[contacting the sales team].

Once a license is purchased you must activate it.
To do so, log into your https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account].
Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Edition# tab.

From there, view the license key appropriate for your needs.

Use the "Production" license for your production server.
The other license is suitable for non-production environments, such as user acceptance testing or development.

[NOTE.note]
====
You can always find your license by logging in to your link:https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account] and then navigating to the [breadcrumb]#Editions# tab.
If you do not have a license there, you are on Community edition.
In that case, no license is required.
====

After you have your license key, log in to your FusionAuth instance.
The credentials you use for this have no connection to the credentials you used to log into your account portal.
Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Reactor# tab and enter your license in the [field]#License Id# field.

In an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)[air gapped] configuration where outbound network access is not available, the license text will be available in your https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account].
Include this text in addition to the license when activating.
If you need an air gapped license because your application will not have internet access or for any other reason, please link:/contact[contact sales] for more information.

Immediately after activating, FusionAuth must obtain a secure connection to FusionAuth's servers. 
It may take a minute or two to complete activation.

Once that has happened, the [field]#Licensed# field will change to a green checkmark.
This may require a page refresh.
You will also see a list of premium features.
Depending on your particular edition, some may not be active.
You can see a list of features on the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/premium-features[premium features page].

== Decommissioning Your License

Should you need to decommission your license, either because you are changing your editions or rotating your license key, you can do so by using the "Decomission" link.
