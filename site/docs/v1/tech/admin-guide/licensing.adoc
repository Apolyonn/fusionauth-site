== Adding Your License to Your Instance

To access paid features, purchase a license via the link:/pricing[pricing page] or by link:/contact[contacting the sales team].

Once a license is purchased you must activate it.
To do so, log into your https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account].
Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Edition# tab.

From there, view the license Id appropriate for your needs.

Use the "Production" license Id for your production server.
This will be used to calculate your monthly active users (MAU), which may affect your monthly bill.
link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users#what-makes-a-user-active[Learn more about MAU here].
The other license Id is suitable for non-production environments, such as user acceptance testing or development.

[NOTE.note]
====
You can always find your license Id by logging in to your link:https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account] and then navigating to the [breadcrumb]#Editions# tab.
If you do not have a license Id there, you are on Community edition.
In that case, no license is required.
====

After you have your license Id, log in to your FusionAuth instance.
The credentials you use for this have no connection to the credentials you used to log into your account portal.
Navigate to the [breadcrumb]#Reactor# tab and enter your license Id in the [field]#License Id# field.

In an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)[air gapped] configuration where outbound network access is not available, the license text will be available in your https://account.fusionauth.io/account[Account].
Include this text in addition to the license Id when activating.
If you need an air gapped license because your application will not have internet access or for any other reason, please link:/contact[contact sales] for more information.

Immediately after activating, FusionAuth must obtain a secure connection to FusionAuth's servers. 
It may take a minute or two to complete activation.

Once that has happened, the [field]#Licensed# field will change to a green checkmark.
This may require a page refresh.
You will also see a list of premium features.
Depending on your particular edition, some may not be active.
You can see a list of features on the link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/premium-features[premium features page].

== Deactivating Your License

Should you need to deactivate your license Id, either because you are changing your editions or rotating your license Id, you can do so by using the "Deactivate" link, in the upper right hand corner of the Reactor page.

== The License API

You can use the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/reactor[Reactor API] to activate or deactivate your license. 

You can also retrieve data on the license status of your instance, including whether specific features are enabled or disabled.

== Licensing and Kickstart

You can set your license Id using Kickstart as well.
Doing so allows you to use features requiring a license in your development environment and continuous integration systems.
You should use the non-production license Id in your Kickstart files.
