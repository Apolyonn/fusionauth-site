[NOTE]
====
This document covers the configuration for FusionAuth's SAML v2 identity provider, where FusionAuth is the system of record for users, and other applications authenticate against FusionAuth.

If you are looking for instructions to setup FusionAuth as a SAML v2 service provider (i.e. you want to allow users to log into either FusionAuth's UI or your applications via a third party SAML v2 identity provider), consult the documentation under link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/[SAML v2 Identity Provider].
