FusionAuth supports SAML both as an Identity Provider (IdP) and as a Service Provider (SP). 

The IdP implementation has certain limitations. Version `2.0` is supported; other SAML versions are unsupported.

Please examine the documented `NameIDPolicy` of the software package for which you are configuring FusionAuth to act as the IdP to determine the correct value.

[NOTE.since]
====
Since version 1.28, FusionAuth supports any `NameIDPolicy` value.

Prior to that version, FusionAuth supported two `NameIDPolicy` values:

* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
* `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`
====


FusionAuth supports the following SAMLv2 bindings:

* HTTP Redirect 
* HTTP POST

Other bindings are not supported.
