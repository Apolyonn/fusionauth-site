== Access Denied

If you see an Access Denied error in your browser while using the FusionAuth UI, this could be caused by a mis-configured CDN or proxy. This error often produces a 4xx error code such as a 403. In order to fix this issue, ensure that your CDN, proxy or gateway does not prevent traffic from flowing directly to FusionAuth. FusionAuth is able to handle all HTTP traffic and any network handling between the browser and FusionAuth should be as simple as possible.
