If your plugin is not installed, ensure:

* You have added the binding with a unique name to a Guice module.
* You have built the jar file correctly and it contains both the Guice module and the implementation of the `PasswordEncryptor` class.
* You have placed the jar file in the top level `plugins` directory and the file and directory are readable by the FusionAuth instance.

If you have verified the plugin is installed via the administrative user interface or log messages, but a user with a known password cannot login successfully:

* Ensure that users are imported using the correct name in the [field]#encryptionScheme# field. Review other settings such as the factor as well.
* Add tests to double check that you are hashing the passwords in the way you expect.
