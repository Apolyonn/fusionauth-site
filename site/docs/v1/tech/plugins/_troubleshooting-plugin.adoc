If your plugin is not installed, ensure:

* You have added the binding with a unique name to a Guice module.
* You have built the jar file correctly and the jar file contains both the Guice module and the implementation of the `PasswordEncryptor` class.
* You have placed it in the correct `plugins` directory and it is readable by the FusionAuth process.

If your plugin is installed but not working:

* Check that the plugin is selected as the scheme for the Tenant.
* Ensure that users are imported using the correct name in the [field]#encryptionScheme# field.
* Add some tests to double check that you are hashing the passwords in the way you expect.
