== Set Up a Generic Messenger

Currently, messengers can only be configured to send messages via a SMS protocol. If you need to connect to an SMS provider other than Twilio, you can use the Generic messenger configuration.

The generic messenger allows for a simple JSON REST API integration which allows you to receive a message from FusionAuth and then make an API call to any third party SMS provider you wish.
