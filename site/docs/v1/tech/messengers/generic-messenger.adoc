== Set Up a Generic Messenger

Currently, built-in messengers can only be configured to send messages via a Twilio. If you need to connect to a provider other than Twilio, whether you want to send SMS messages or any other, you can use the Generic messenger configuration.

The generic messenger allows for a simple JSON REST API integration which allows you to receive a message from FusionAuth to an arbitrary URL. The Generic Message Receiver at this URL may then make an API call to any third party messaging provider.

=== Testing Your Configuration

You also can test your generic messenger configuration. By hitting `Test generic configuration` FusionAuth will fire a JSON message to the messenger just created to ensure everything is set up correctly.

== Writing the Generic Message Receiver

You need to write a server side component, a receiver, which will be deployed at a URL and send the actual messages. This component can be written in any language that can consume a JSON message.

=== Request 

The request to your endpoint will be delivered as JSON.

.Example Request JSON
----
include::docs/src/json/messengers/generic-message-request.json[]
----

The components of this message include:

* [field]#phoneNumber#, the number of the user to which to send the message.
* [field]#textMessage#, the message to send. It is built from the configured link:/https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/message-templates/[message template] and will be localized.
* [field]#type#, which is always `SMS`.

When your application receives this message, it should send the notification to the phone number provided. 

After the message is sent, it must return a response. The timeout is configurable.

=== Response 

If sending the message was successful, return a status code in the `200` to `299` range. No further processing will be performed.

If, on the other hand, the receiver application is unsuccessful at sending the message, for whatever reason, return a status code outside of that range.
