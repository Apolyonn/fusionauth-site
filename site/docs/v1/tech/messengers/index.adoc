== Messengers

Messengers are used to send messages from within FusionAuth to other systems. They can be customized using link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[themes].

== Set Up a Messenger

In FusionAuth, you can set up three types of messengers:

- link:twilio-messenger[Set Up a Twilio Messenger]
- link:kafka-messenger[Set Up a Kafka Messenger]
- link:generic-messenger[Set Up a Generic Messenger]

To configure a messenger, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings-> Messengers# and click on the appropriate messenger type in the top right.

== Create a Messenger Template

Message templates are a powerful way to customize messengers and the communication contained within. FusionAuth uses FreeMarker for all templating.

- link:message-templates[Manage Message Templates]

To configure a message template, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Message Templates#.
