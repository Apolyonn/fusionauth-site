== Overview

Application specific themes allows you to use the power of FusionAuth hosted login pages, but to offer a different theme for each application.

This might be useful when different applications for which you use FusionAuth have distinct branding.


== Enabling Application Specific Themes


You need to make sure you enter a license, as this is a paid feature. 

link:/docs/v1/tech/admin-guide/licensing[Learn how to install your license]. 

Next, you need to create a theme. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Themes# and create a new theme.

Next, assign it to the application. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications -> Your Application# and choose a theme from the list of themes.

Now, any user accessing a page that belongs to an application will use that theme.

== Troubleshooting

For application specific theming to work, FusionAuth must know which application is being accessed. This is typically done with the `client_id` parameter, which ties a request to a FusionAuth application. If the `client_id` cannot be determined, FusionAuth will fall back to the tenant theme. Make sure to include `client_id` on any external links, you create.

Application specific theming, as with all theming, isn't very useful if you are not using the FusionAuth hosted login pages.
