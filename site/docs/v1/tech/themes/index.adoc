== Overview

FusionAuth themes allow you to customize the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect login pages and other user workflows such as forgot password. In FusionAuth you may create one to many themes and assign a theme per tenant or application so that you can customize the user experience for different users.

In this guide you will find a video demonstration, a list of each template available to you and some example code.

== Example Video

To demonstrate what is possible with the FusionAuth feature we have created a video that illustrates how to make FusionAuth look like StackOverflow.

== Create a Theme

FusionAuth provides the ability to create and manage themes in the UI as well as a link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/themes/[Themes API] if you prefer to manage themes programatically. Any user of the FusionAuth role of `admin` or `theme_manager` may view, edit, update, and delete Themes.

All of the FusionAuth login templates are written in https://freemarker.apache.org[FreeMarker]. FreeMarker provides a very rich template language that will allow you to customize the pages and helpers to suit your needs. You can also define new macros and function to assist you further.

Below is an example screenshot of the Add Theme panel with each template described below.

=== Form Fields

[.api]
[field]#Id# [optional]#Optional#::
An optional UUID. When this value is omitted a unique Id will be generated automatically.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
A unique name to identity the theme. This name is for display purposes only and it can be modified later if desired.


=== Templates

//=====
// To add a new theme template, do the following
// update site/_date/templates.yaml (further instructions there)
// update the JSON files in site/docs/src/json/themes/ with the new theme template key
// touch this file to regenerate (if in dev mode)
// that's it. the API and the theme form page will be automatically updated.

[.api]
[field]#Stylesheet (CSS)# [optional]#Optional#::
This CSS stylesheet may be used to style the themed pages.
+
This CSS will be included in the `head` tag in the Helpers `head` macro. You may also choose to include other remote stylesheets by using the `<style>` tag within the `head` macro.
+
```
<style>
  ${theme.stylesheet()}
</style>
```

[field]#Messages# [optional]#Optional#::
This section allows you to add additional localized messages to your theme. When creating an additional locale it is not required that all messages are defined for each language. If a message key is not defined for the specified locale, the value from the default bundles will be used.
+
If you intend to localize your login templates, you may find our https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization[community contributed and maintained messages in our GitHub repository] helpful.

[field]#Helpers# [required]#Required#::
This template contains all of the main helper macros to define the `head`, `body` and `footer`. To begin theming FusionAuth you'll want to start with this template as it will affect all other templates.
+
See <<Helpers>> section below for additional information.

{% include docs/_theme_form.liquid %}


== Helpers

In addition to the pages listed above, FusionAuth has a template that contains a number of macros used in all of the page templates. This template is located at `../_helpers.ftl` and it contains a number of FreeMarker macros. The rest of the pages use these macros to generate various pieces of the HTML. The macros contained in `_helpers.ftl` are:

=== Section Helpers

* `html`
** Renders the `<html>` element
* `head`
** Renders the `<head>` element and everything inside it including the `<title>`, CSS, Java Script, and meta information
* `body`
** Renders the `<body>` element
* `header`
** Renders any type of header for each page. This could be a navigation bar, side bar, or page details
* `main`
** Renders the main content body of each page. If all of your pages will have similar HTML elements like a container, this is the place to put them.
* `footer`
** Renders the footer content of each page. This might contain links, nav, privacy policies, etc.

Here is an example of what one of these helpers looks like:

[source,html]
.HTML helper
----
[#macro html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  [#nested/]
</html>
[/#macro]
----

The key to these macros is the `[#nested/]` element. This is the location that FreeMarker will insert any nested content when you use the macro. Here is an example of using this macro:

[source,html]
.Example usage of HTML macro
----
[@helpers.html]
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
[/@helpers.html]
----

Everything inside the macro will be place where the `[#nested/]` element is. Therefore, the result of our example would be this HTML:

[source,html]
.Example result
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
----

All of the page templates use these macros, which makes it much easier to style all of the pages at one time. You simply edit the macros and your changes will take effect on all of the pages listed above.

=== Social (alternative) Login Helpers

In addition to the section helpers, the `_helpers.ftl` template also contains a few additional macros that can be used to setup social and alternative logins. Currently, FusionAuth supports these social login providers:

* Apple
* Epic Games
* Facebook
* Google
* HYPR
* LinkedIn
* Sony PlayStation Network
* Steam
* Twitch
* Twitter
* Xbox
* Generic OpenID Connect
* Generic SAML v2
* Generic SAML v2 Identity Provider Initiated

This macro can be included on the Authorize or Register page.

* `/oauth2/authorize`
* `/oauth2/register`, available since 1.28.0

Once you have configured your alternative logins (called identity providers in the interface and API), they will appear on the FusionAuth stock login form. This is because our stock login form includes this code:

[source,html]
.Social login code
----
[@helpers.head]
  [@helpers.alternativeLoginsScript clientId=client_id identityProviders=identityProviders/]
  ...
[/@helpers.head]

[@helpers.body]
  ...

  [@helpers.alternativeLogins clientId=client_id identityProviders=identityProviders/]
[/@helpers.body]
----

The first macro (`alternativeLoginScripts`) includes the JavaScript libraries that FusionAuth uses to hook up the identity providers. Unless you want to write your own JavaScript or use a third-party library, you will need this JavaScript in the `<head>` tag in order for FusionAuth to leverage external login providers.

The second macro (`alternativeLogins`) produces the login buttons for each of the configured identity providers. These buttons are all hooked up to the JavaScript included in the `<head>` of the page in order to make it all work nicely.

You might want to use your own buttons for social logins. This is possible with FusionAuth, but you will need to do a couple of things to make it all work.

First, you need to remove the `[@helpers.alternativeLogins]` macro call.

Second, you need to use a specific `id` or `class` on your HTML element for the button. Here are the `id` s or `class` es for each identity provider:

* `id="apple-login-button"` is used for Apple
* `id="epicgames-login-button"` is used for Epic Games
* `id="google-login-button"` is used for Google
* `id="facebook-login-button"` is used for Facebook
* `id="linkedin-login-button"` is used for LinkedIn
* `id="sonypsn-login-button"` is used for Sony PlayStation Network
* `id="steam-login-button"` is used for Steam
* `id="twitch-login-button"` is used for Twitch
* `id="twitter-login-button"` is used for Twitter
* `id="xbox-login-button"` is used for Xbox
* `class="openid login-button"` is used for Generic OpenID Connect
* `class="samlv2 login-button"` is used for Generic SAML v2

And finally, you need to ensure that Prime.js is included on your page. This library ships with FusionAuth and you just need to ensure it is included like this:

[source,html]
.Prime.js include
----
<script src="/js/prime-min.js"></script>
----

=== Alert and Error Helpers

The `_helpers.ftl` template also provides a couple of macros that can be used to output errors and alerts that might occur. The best bet is to include these macros in your `main` macro. Here are the macros and their purpose:

* `printErrorAlerts`
** This outputs any error alerts. These are normally displayed at the top of the page and you might want to make them able to be dismiss (i.e. removed from the page).
* `printInfoAlerts`
** This outputs any informational alerts. These are the same as the errors, but might have different CSS.
* `alert`
** This macro is used by the `printErrorAlerts` and `printInfoAlerts` but you can also use it directly to display an error or info message anywhere on the page.

=== Form Helpers

The `_helpers.ftl` template also provides a couple of macros that help render form elements and output form errors. Here are the macros you can use:

* `hidden`
** This outputs a hidden input element. Many pieces of the OAuth workflow and the other pages in FusionAuth use hidden form fields to store data. This macro uses the `eval` feature of FreeMarker in order to pull in data that was in the request. You shouldn't edit this macro unless you know what you are doing.
* `input`
** This outputs an input element plus a label and any errors that might have occurred on the form field. You can use this for text, passwords, and other input elements. FusionAuth also leverages `addons` which are icons next to the input field that provide visual cues to the user. This macro allows you to leverage addons as well. Similar to the `hidden` element, you should not edit this unless you know what you are doing.
* `errors`
** This macro is used by the `input` macro to render errors on the field. You can use this if you write your own `input` macros. Otherwise, you likely won't use this.
* `button`
** This macro renders a button that can be used to submit a form. The FusionAuth version of this macro includes an icon and the button text.

== Preview a Theme

=== Previewing a theme

If you want to see how your theme works, you can always open a browser with no active FusionAuth session and visit the hosted login pages.

However, at times, you may need to make changes in your theme that you want to view without going through an entire registration process. You can easily do so by previewing the theme via the administrative user interface.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Customizations -> Themes#. Choose your theme, then click the preview link (the green magnifying glass):

image::theme-preview-button.png[Preview your theme,width=1200,role=shadowed bottom-cropped]

This will open a new tab. Click on any of the pages you've modifed in the left hand navigation, for example [field]#OAuth register#, and you'll see the page as it would be rendered.

== Example Code

=== Example of Customizing the Authorize Page

Now that you have a good overview of all the templates, macros and helpers, here is an example of customizing the Authorize page.

Let's assume you want to change the header and footer across all of the pages including the Authorize page. This is accomplished by editing the `helpers.header` and `helpers.footer` macros. For the header, let's assume you want to add a `Sign Up` and `Login` link. For the footer, let's assume you want to add a link to your privacy policy. Here are the macros that include these new links:

[source,html]
.Custom header helper
----
[#macro header]
  <header class="my-custom-header">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="login"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/login">Login</li>
        <li class="sign-up"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/sign-up">Sign Up</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
----

[source,html]
.Custom footer helper
----
[#macro footer]
  <footer class="my-custom-footer">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li class="privacy-policy"><a target="_blank" href="https://my-application.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>

  [#nested/]
[/#macro]
----

Once you make these changes, they will take effect on all of the pages listed above.

== Template Variables

Each template has different variables that are available to it. These variables can be used in the template to help with rendering the HTML. There are also a couple of common variables that are available in all of the pages. The common variables and the page specific variables are all listed below:

By default FusionAuth will provide HTML escaping on all values rendered in HTML, this protects you from script injection attacks. If you find a value that is being incorrectly escaped you may need to utilize the FreeMarker built in for no-escape `?no_esc`.

{% include docs/_theme_variables_toc.liquid %}

=== Common Variables


==== Variables

[.api]
[field]#application# [type]#[Application]#::
The application resolved by the provided [field]#client_id# provided on the request. If the request was made without a [field]#client_id# then this variable will be undefined. Ensure you reference it using a null safe strategy if you are using some of the themed pages without a [field]#client_id#.

[field]#client_id# [type]#[String]#::
The OAuth v2.0 `client_id` parameter. This is synonymous with FusionAuth's Application Id.

[field]#currentUser# [type]#[User]# [since]#Available since 1.30.0#::
When there is an active SSO session, this variable will contain the currently logged in user. When an SSO session does not yet exist, this variable will be undefined.

[field]#errorMessages# [type]#[Array<String>]#::
A list of error messages that were generated during the processing of the request.

[field]#fieldMessages# [type]#[Map<String, List<String>>]#::
A map of field messages (usually errors) that were generated during the processing of the request. The key into the map is the name of the form field and the value is a list that contains the errors for that form field.

[field]#locale# [type]#[Locale]#::
The locale used to localize messages.
+
