==== verificationId is Invalid or Expired

If users report receiving a code or link to verify their email or registration but the included verificationIds do not work, you will want ot review you configuration settings.

There are two email templates available within FusionAuth

- Registration Verification
- Email Verification

Each template should be set correctly.  For instance, Email verification template only works by navigating to `Tenants > Emails > Email Verfication Template`.  If the default Registration Verification template is selected, the emails sent will not function appropriately for the user.
