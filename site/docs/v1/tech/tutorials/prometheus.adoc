Prometheus is a tool to monitor metrics and setup alerts in the case that some metric has responded negatively for an extended period. Setting this up with FusionAuth is easy.

=== Setup
The only requirement to hookup FusionAuth is to direct prometheus to the FusionAuth prometheus endpoints. We used the following configuration for a FusionAuth instance running locally on the docker host. (You can reach dockers host ip via `host.docker.internal` on mac and windows docker.)

[source,yaml]
.prometheus.yaml
----
include::docs/src/yaml/prometheus.yaml[]
----

We then started prometheus with
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yaml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
