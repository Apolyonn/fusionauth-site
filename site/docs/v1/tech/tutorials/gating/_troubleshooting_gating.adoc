=== The links don't function as expected for email verification or application registration.

When a user clicks on an email to verify their application registration or verify their email, the link does not work (expired or other error)

==== Possible Solution One

Ensure you have selected the correct template for emailing.  For instance, if attempting to verify application registration, ensure you have selected the appropriate template (`registration verification` as opposed to `email verification` in this instance).

**For email verification**

==== Possible Solution Two

Ensure your external identifier timeouts are appropriate.  These are the timeouts for how long a email `verificationId` is valid from time of issue, for instance.  Reasable defaults are set, but they can be adjusted (`Tenants > Tenants > External identifier durations`), with particular attention paid to `Email verification` and `Registration verification` durations.
