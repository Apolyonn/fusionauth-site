=== Retroactive Emails Once Gate Enabled?

**Question**: Will all my existing users get emails for either gate once enabled?

**Answer**:  No. More specifically, this is an accurate statement if you have **never** enabled email verification and/or application registration verification and imported your users with a `verified: true` value (as applicable).

To double-check your users, click on [breadcrumb]#Users -> Search Bar# and perform this elasticsearch query -- `verified: false`. Note,  this will return for both the `users` and `user.registrations[x] objects`. The users returned from this query will be required to verify either email or application registration once the gate is enabled. However, **they will not be emailed until they attempt a login**. Even then, they will click on a link from a hosted page to have another verification email sent to them.

=== Are Manual Changes Possible?

**Question**: What if have accidentally/inadvertently imported users with a `verified: false` value (either on the user or application registration)?  In other words, I need all my existing users to have a `verified: true` value.

**Answer**: Currently, there is no way to change this value manually. However, there is an open issue to add this functionality. Please upvote if you believe this is needed.

== What About Enabling Both Gates?

**Question**: What does it mean to enable both registration and email gates and verification paths?

**Answer**: If you enable both registration verification and email verification, there will be a bit of redundancy (this is fine and expected). Consider the use case of ten applications and one common tenant. Maybe nine of those applications require only email verification, but the tenth application requires an application gate(to force user opt-in behaviors).
