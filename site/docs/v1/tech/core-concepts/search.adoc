== Overview

FusionAuth ships with two options for search: a simple search via the database search engine and the Elasticsearch database engine.

* <<Using the database search engine>>
* <<Using the Elasticsearch search engine>>

== Configuration

[NOTE.since]
====

As of version 1.16.0, FusionAuth ships with a database search engine as the default.

By selecting the appropriate link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fast-path[Fast Path installation], one can easily download a configuration with Elasticsearch pre-enabled.

====

==== Configuration Reference

See link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/configuration/[Configuration Reference] for details on configuring the search engine and (optional) Elasticsearch integration.

Highlighted here:

_Properties_

- [field]#fusionauth-app.search-engine-type#
- [field]#fusionauth-app.search-servers#

_Environment variables_

- `FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_ENGINE_TYPE`
- `FUSIONAUTH_SEARCH_SERVERS`

==== Switch engine types

You may also link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/switch-search-engines/[switch between the different search engines].

==== Docker
If you are running FusionAuth in a Docker environment, see the link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker/[Using FusionAuth on Docker] documentation for an example configuring Elasticsearch as the user search engine.


==== View current configuration

You may view the configured search engine type in the FusionAuth admin UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#System -> About#.

== Using the database search engine

This configuration is lightweight, simplifies installation and system complexity, but comes with the trade offs of limited search capabilities and performance implications.

The database search engine is appropriate for systems that are not dependent on the FusionAuth API's, are not expected to have a large number of search results, and may be running in an embedded environment.

If you don't need advanced searching capabilities, you may be able to use the database search engine for large installations. This is not a use case FusionAuth tests, so ensure you provision your database with enough resources and benchmark your typical use cases.

=== Limitations

You may add a `*` character to wildcard match any character, including none. So `*piedpiper` will match `piedpiper` and `thepiedpiper`. You may put the wildcard at any location in a search string.

All search terms are converted to lowercase and compared with lowercase values.

Regular expressions, ranges, and other complicated queries can not be used.

== Using the Elasticsearch search engine

Leveraging Elasticsearch, enables advanced search capabilities on more numerous and granular data and a performance improvement.

The Elasticsearch search engine is appropriate for systems that are dependent on the FusionAuth API's (such as link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users#search-for-users[users]), are expected to have a large number of results, and requires a more tactical search than is provided by the database search engine.

=== Reindex

[WARNING]
====
Reindexing is an expensive operation, especially if your system has a large number of users, so it should not be run unless necessary.
====

It is possible, though rare, for an Elasticsearch index to become out of sync with the database. If you stand up FusionAuth with a database dump and restore, you may need to run this operation. You may also be instructed to do so by FusionAuth support.

In general, even if a temporary outage occurs with Elasticsearch, the index will be sync up automatically.


If you do need to run this, navigate to [breadcrumb]#System -> Reindex# in the FusionAuth admin UI to initiate a reindex of all users. This navigation item will only be displayed when the search engine is Elasticsearch.
