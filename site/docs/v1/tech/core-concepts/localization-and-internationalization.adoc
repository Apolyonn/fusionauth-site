== Localization

TBD break out to separate section under core concepts

Internationalization

Localizatoin

Translation

FusionAuth is built from the ground up with localization in mind. The [field]#preferredLanguages# field in both the User and Registration objects stores a user's locale. Each application registration can also have an associated preferred language associated, if different applications have different supported languages.

FusionAuth supports both translation and localization in the FusionAuth interfaces.

=== User Languages in Applications

You can assign a user's [field]#preferredLanguages# via the API or link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/advanced-registration-forms/[advanced registration form]. 

After assignment, add the language value to a JWT to be presented to other applications. You may also retrieve the languages from via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/users[User API]. This allows you to store a user's preferred locale in FusionAuth and use it across all applications.

The default application registration form has [field]#preferredLanguages# field.

=== The FusionAuth User Facing Interfaces

Both the hosted login pages and the emails can be localized and translated. Except as noted below, you will have to perform the localization.

Hosted login pages can be customized with link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/localization/[themes]. Emails can be customized with link:/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates/[email templates]. 

==== Provided Hosted Login Pages Translations 

The hosted login pages, which are displayed for link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/integration-points/#hosted-login-pages[user facing login flows], have been translated into a number of languages. These are available for installation into FusionAuth. The current list of languages is:

Visit the https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-localization/[fusionauth-localization GitHub repo] to view current translations or contribute one.

=== Localization and the FusionAuth Admin UI

There are no translations of the FusionAuth administrative user interface. Currently the only supported language is English. However, you can localize the FusionAuth interface's display of dates, times and numbers. To do so, set the user's preferred language. Items such as dates and numbers will be formatted based on the user's locale. 

FusionAuth supports the following locales for the administrative user interface.

* Arabic (ar)
* Czech (cs)
* Danish (da)
* German (de)
* Greek (el)
* English (en)
* English - US (en_us)
* Spanish (es)
* French (fr)
* Irish (ga)
* Hebrew (he)
* Hindi (hi)
* Italian (it)
* Japanese (ja)
* Korean (ko)
* Dutch (nl)
* Norwegian (no)
* Portuguese (pt)
* Russian (ru)
* Swedish (sv)
* Chinese (zh)
* Chinese - Simplified (zh_CN)
* Chinese - Traditional (zh_TW)

[NOTE]
====
The above list is of localizations of the administrative user interface for date, time and numbers, not translations of the entire user interface.

In the below screenshot, Richard's has a [field]#preferredLanguage# of `French`. When Richard interacts with the FusionAuth administrative user interface, the account with the email `dinesh@fusionauth.io`, created on Oct 5, 2020, has a displayed date formatted as specified by the French locale, with the day first.
