== Overview

Roles in FusionAuth are associated with an link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/[application].

You can define as many roles as you want in an application. There are no limits on the number of roles a user or a group can have.

Roles are often used by APIs and applications to control access to functionality. For example, Zendesk presents a different user interface to users with the `agent` role than to users without that role.

You can associate roles with link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/[users] directly via their link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations/[registration]. Or you can assign an application role to a link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups/[group], and then any users in that group who have access to that application will have that role.

Roles have the following attributes:
