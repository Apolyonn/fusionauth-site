== Overview

Roles in FusionAuth are associated with an link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/[application]. You can define as many roles as you want in an application. There are no limits on the number of roles a user or a group can have. 

Roles are application specific and may be specific to the domain of the application. Roles are typically used by APIs and applications to control access to functionality. For example, Zendesk presents a different user interface to users with the `agent` role than to users without that role. 

For a further example, an e-commerce application may have the following roles:

* `admin`
* `seller`
* `shopper`

On the other hand, a content management system may have these roles:

* `admin`
* `editor`
* `contributor`
* `subscriber`

Roles are available in the link:/docs/v1/tech/oauth/tokens/[JWT] upon successful link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/authentication-authorization[authorization] and are also returned as part of the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations/[user's registrations].

You can associate roles with link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/[users] directly via their link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/registrations/[registration]. Or you can assign an application role to a link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups/[group], and then any users in that group who have access to that application will have that role.

=== Role Attributes

=== FusionAuth Application Roles

The FusionAuth application which provides the administrative user interface for the FusionAuth instance provides a number of built-in roles. These can be assigned to any user registered with the FusionAuth admin application. These roles control access to functionality within the FusionAuth administrative user interface. 

[NOTE]
====
These roles are used only internally to manage authorization within the FusionAuth administrative user interface application.

These roles are *not global* and are not present in any other applications for which FusionAuth provides authentication, authorization or user management.

Below you can see the administrative user interface screen where you assign roles in the FusionAuth application to a user.

In general, any role ending in `_viewer` can view entities of a particular type, any role ending in `_manager` can add or edit the entities, and any role ending in `_deleter` can delete entities.
