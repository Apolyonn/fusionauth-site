== Overview

Registrations in FusionAuth are the link between link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/[users] and link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications/[applications].

A user can have zero or more registrations. 

The link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/registrations/[registrations API] documents the allowed attributes of a user registration.
