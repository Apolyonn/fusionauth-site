== Overview

Signing keys and certificates are managed in FusionAuth using Key Master. After creating or importing a key, use it with other FusionAuth functionality, such as signing JSON Web Tokens or SAML Requests. This page describes the Admin UI for creating and managing signing keys.

* TODO TOC ...

You can also manage keys via the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/keys[Keys API].

== Create or Manage Keys

To create a new tenant, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Key Master#. Here you will see a list of keys and certificates.

image::key-master/default-keymaster-list.png[Default Key Master Listing.,width=1200]

From this page, you can add and import keys and certificates as well as view and remove keys.

There are certain default keys that you cannot remove. See the link:/docs/v1/tech/reference/limitations/[FusionAuth limitations].

Select the operation you want to run from the menu on the listing page.

== Importing vs Generating

You can import keys and certificates. This is useful if you are integrating with an external system. For instance, you may be migrating from another auth system and want to import keys generated by that auth system to ensure anything signed with those keys will continue to work.

You can generate keys as well.

[field]#Name# [required]#Required#::
The name of the Key. This must be unique.

[field]#Key Identifier# [optional]#Optional#::
