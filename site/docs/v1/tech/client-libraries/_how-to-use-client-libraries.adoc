FusionAuth client libraries are a bit different than full featured SDKs that you might have encountered before.
They are a thin wrapper around the REST API.

Client libraries are used in two different ways.

First, they can be used to access the FusionAuth link:/docs/v1/tech/apis[APIs] in a familiar format, leveraging language features like auto-completion.
When used for this, they can be helpful to script FusionAuth configuration, automate common tasks, and create copies of existing applications, groups and more.

The message content for each API call is a wrapper around the JSON specified in the documentation.

To use the client libraries effectively in this way, it is helpful to review the source code of the client library and the API documentation, which contains the JSON structure.
The API documentation is very thorough about the JSON objects it expects as part of the payload as well as what parameters are required when.

Second, client libraries can exchange a token to let a user to log via the Authorization Code Grant.
This is a secondary use of these libraries.
This process is best done by using a language specific OAuth library, which work out of the box with FusionAuth.
Here is a https://oauth.net/code/[community curated list of such libraries]

Client libraries do not currently provide higher level functionality such as token management.
Here is an https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1674[open issue] detailing some requested higher level functionality.
Please feel free to file an issue or upvote this one if you desire it.

You can always directly call the REST API if the client library functionality doesn't work for you.
