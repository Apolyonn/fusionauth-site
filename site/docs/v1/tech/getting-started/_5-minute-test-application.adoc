Now that everything is written, let's test the workflow. We can fire up the Node.js application using this command:

[source,shell script,title=Start the node server]
----
npm start
----

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in an incognito browser.

[NOTE.note]
====
You need to use an incognito browser because otherwise FusionAuth won't prompt you to login, since you already logged into FusionAuth when you configured the application above.

FusionAuth offers single sign-on, and will automatically redirect you to the application if you are already logged in with the FusionAuth server.

Click the `Login` link, this will take us to FusionAuth's login page.

From here, you can log in with the account you used to access the admin user interface above. If you log in with a valid account that is registered for the application, you arrive at the home page, but are greeted by name.

In a real application, there'd be a lot more than a "Hello" message, but this is the building block. You can add other pages, display additional information based on other attributes of the user, and more. You've successfully authenticated and stored user data in the express session.

If, on the other hand, you use an account that has a valid account, but is not registered for the application, you'll end up at a page telling you so.
