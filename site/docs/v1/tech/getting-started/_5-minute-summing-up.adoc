You've now taken an application and layered on authentication with FusionAuth. A user who is registered for the application can log in, view private data, and log out.

Congrats!

You can also start working with link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[themes] to make the login pages look like your application, or work through some link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/[tutorials in other programming languages].
