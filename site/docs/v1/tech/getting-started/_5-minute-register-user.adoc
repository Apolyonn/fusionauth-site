Next, grant the user you created in the Setup Wizard permissions to log into your new Application. This can be done from the User management section of the FusionAuth admin UI. Click the [breadcrumb]#Users# link in the navigation. Click on the user:

Once you are in this user's account, you'll click the "Add Registration" button. This will take us to a page that will allow us to add a registration for this user to the new Application. Registrations associate users with applications.

Here's the screen to add the registration:

For this tutorial, you don't need to provide any additional information for the registration; click the save button at the top.

Now the user is set up so that they can log into the application.

[NOTE.note]
====
FusionAuth supports users self-registering. In that case, the registration will be added when the user signs up. What you just used is normally not required in order for users to log in. However, this process can be used for applications that are closed systems such as internal applications for your company. In these cases, users will be manually granted permissions to each application by an administrator.
