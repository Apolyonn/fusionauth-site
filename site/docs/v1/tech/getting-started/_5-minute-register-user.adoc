Next, grant the user you created in the Setup Wizard permissions to log into your new Application. This can be done from the User management section of the FusionAuth admin UI. Click the [breadcrumb]#Users# link in the navigation. If needed search for the user.

Manage the user's details by clicking on the black "Manage" button:

Once you are in this user's account, you'll click the "Add Registration" button. This will take us to a page that will allow us to add a registration for this user to the new Application. Registrations associate users with applications. You may have to select an Application if there are multiple options.

For this tutorial, you don't need to provide any additional information for the registration; click the save button at the top.

Now the user is set up so that they can log into the application.

[NOTE.note]
====
The steps to add a registration to a user that you just went through are not always required to let your users log in. FusionAuth supports users self-registering. In that case, the registration will be added when the user signs up.
