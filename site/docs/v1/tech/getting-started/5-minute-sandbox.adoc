:installmethod: sandbox

You've chosen to use the FusionAuth hosted sandbox for the setup guide.

This is the best option if you want to get up and running quickly or if you plan to use the SaaS version of FusionAuth but want to get going.

The sandbox also runs a licensed version of FusionAuth, so if you want to explore any of the link:/docs/v1/tech/premium-features[premium features] without paying, you can use it to do so.

[WARNING.warning]
====
The FusionAuth sandbox environment is useful for testing out FusionAuth functionality, but it is open to the world; anyone can view the user data stored there.

The system is also reset regularly to a standard configuration, wiping all the data.

**Please, do not** use the sandbox for production.

**Please, do not** put private data in the sandbox.

If you'd like to have your own private instance of FusionAuth in the cloud, managed by FusionAuth, link:/pricing[purchase hosting].

== Requirements

TODO extract requirements?
You need to have Node installed. This code has been tested with node 18, but should work with other versions.

[source,shell script,title=Testing Node Installation]
----
$ node -v
v14.4.0
----

== Overview

Here are the steps that you need to take to set up FusionAuth to provide login and logout for your application:

. xref:1-log-into-the-sandbox[Log into the sandbox]
. xref:2-create-an-application-and-configure-the-oauth-settings[Create an Application and configure the OAuth settings]
. xref:3-grant-permissions[Grant permissions]
. xref:4-configure-the-backend-to-complete-the-login[Configure the Backend to Complete the Login]
. xref:5-store-the-user-object-in-the-session[Store the user object in the session]
. xref:6-test-the-application[Test the application]

== 1. Log Into the Sandbox Server

Navigate to the sandbox server, at https://sandbox.fusionauth.io[sandbox.fusionauth.io,target=_new].

Log in following the instructions on the login screen.

After doing so you'll arrive at the sandbox dashboard.

== 2. Create an Application and Configure the OAuth settings

include::docs/v1/tech/getting-started/_5-minute-application-setup.adoc[]

== 3. Grant Permissions 

include::docs/v1/tech/getting-started/_5-minute-register-user.adoc[]

== 4. Configure the Backend to Complete the Login

include::docs/v1/tech/getting-started/_5-minute-configure-node-application.adoc[]

== 5. Store the User Object In The Session

include::docs/v1/tech/getting-started/_5-minute-store-user-object.adoc[]

== 6. Test the application

Now that everything is written, let's test the workflow. We can fire up the Node.js application using this command:

[source,shell script,title=Start the node server]
----
npm start
----

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in an incognito browser.

[NOTE.note]
====
You need to use an incognito browser because otherwise FusionAuth won't prompt you to login, since you already logged into FusionAuth when you configured the application above.

FusionAuth offers single sign-on, and will automatically redirect you to the application if you are already logged in with the FusionAuth server.
====

image::getting-started/5-minute-guide/nodejs-application-login.png[The Node Home Screen,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]


Click the `Login` link, this will take us to FusionAuth's login page.

image::getting-started/5-minute-guide/login{imagesuffix}.png[The Login Screen,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

From here, you can log in with the account you used to access the admin user interface above. If you log in with a valid account that is registered for the application, you arrive at the home page, but are greeted by name.

image::getting-started/5-minute-guide/login-succeeded.png[Successful Login,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped,shadowed]

In a real application, there'd be a lot more than a "Hello" message, but this is the building block. You can add other pages, display additional information based on other attributes of the user, and more. You've successfully authenticated and stored user data in the express session.

If, on the other hand, you use an account that has a valid account, but is not registered for the application, you'll end up at a page telling you so.

== 7. Logout

Of course, for every login, there should be a corresponding logout. Log out by clicking on the "Logout" link. This will log you out of both FusionAuth and the application.

Here's the view code which handles logout.

[source,javascript,title=The Logout Link]
----
//...
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node/master/views/index.pug[tags=logoutLink]
//...
----

What this does is send the user to FusionAuth, where the FusionAuth session is destroyed, and then to the logout URL which was configured when you set up the Application in FusionAuth, `\http://localhost:3000/logout`. That code destroys the local session, logging the user out from the node application.

[source,javascript,title=Destroying the Local Session]
----
//...
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node/master/routes/index.js[tags=logoutRoute]
//...
----

== 8. Summing Up

You've now taken an application and layered on authentication with FusionAuth. A user who is registered for the application can log in, view private data, and log out.

From here, you can link:/docs/v1/tech/guides/basic-registration-forms[set up self-service registration page].  You can also start working with link:/docs/v1/tech/themes/[themes] to make the login pages look like your application. or read link:/docs/v1/tech/tutorials/[tutorials in other programming languages].

FusionAuth is beginning to work on a ten minute guide and a 42 minute guide. What topics would you want to learn next? Please choose two at most.
