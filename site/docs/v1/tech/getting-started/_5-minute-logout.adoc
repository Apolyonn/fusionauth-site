Of course, for every login, there should be a corresponding logout. Log out by clicking on the "Logout" link. This will log you out of both FusionAuth and the application.

Here's the view code which handles logout.

[source,javascript,title=The Logout Link]

What this does is send the user to FusionAuth, where the FusionAuth session is destroyed, and then to the logout URL which was configured when you set up the Application in FusionAuth, `\http://localhost:3000/logout`. That code destroys the local session, logging the user out from the node application.
