== Overview

A FusionAuth Application is simply something a user can log into. When you use the Login API, you will provide an `applicationId` to indicate what resource you're attempting to obtain authorization.

When you use one of the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authorization grants you will provide a `client_id` in some fashion. This client identifier will be unique to a single FusionAuth application which allows FusionAuth to to verify the User is registered for the requested Application and subsequently return the correct roles.

The `applicationId` and `client_id` can be considered synonymous, both concepts leverage the same "Id" value.

== Create an Application

Before you start your integration with FusionAuth you need to setup at least one Application. Applications are the way that FusionAuth manages
registrations of a user. If you haven't read the link:../getting-started/[Overview] section yet, it describes the relationship
between **Users** and **Applications**. An Application in FusionAuth represents an authenticated resource.

Click on [breadcrumb]#Applications# from the main menu to add an application. At a minimum, you must provide a [field]#Name# for the Application and the [field]#Tenant# it belongs to.

== Application Configuration

=== Roles
You can optionally define roles for your Application at the time of creation.

Protected resources in an application can be managed by User roles.  Your application can define authorization rules based on a user's roles.

A role with "Default" enabled will apply this role to all new users registered to this application.  A role with "Super Role" enabled will mark this role as a super role in API responses for the application.

Once an application has been created, roles may be added, updated, and deleted through the "Manage Roles" interface.  This interface can be found by clicking the "Manage Roles" button on the [breadcrumb]#Applications# menu.
