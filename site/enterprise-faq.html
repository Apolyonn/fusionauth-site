        <h1>More questions?</h1>
        <h3>Why don't you have a sales team?</h3>
        <p>
          We got tired of dealing with procurement managers who want to endlessly negotiate pricing and legal terms for no reason until one or both parties ultimately die of exhaustion or boredom. We prefer to spend our time making great software, so we fired our sales team and spent the budget on growing the product team. It may sounds counterintuitive to allocate resources to improve the product we're selling, rather than to spend time making PDFs selling it, but we've had pretty reasonable success with this strategy.
        </p>
        <h3>So how am I supposed to buy your software for my company?</h3>
        <p>
          Go ahead and <a href='/pricing'>download the community edition</a> and check out how awesome FusionAuth is. Then <a href='/pricing'>buy a plan</a> that suits your needs. Buying software doesn't need to be a long drawn out process, it can be simple if you want it to be. Our customers include many large organisations, as you can see right here on this page. If they can figure it out, your company probably can too. We believe in you.
        </p>
        <h3>What about all my compliance, security and special requirements?</h3>
        <p>
          We can accommodate almost any requirements, and are happy to put you on a custom plan to match your needs. You let us know what you need, and we'll let you know how much extra that will cost.
        </p>
        <h3>What is this outrageous, unorthodox sales strategy?</h3>
        <p>
          We make software. If you would like to buy our software, we are happy to accept money in return for goods and services. If you feel that other software would suit you better, that is also fine.
        </p>
        <h3>Can we just schedule a quick call?</h3>
        <p>
          If we can't easily answer your question by email, we'd be happy to set up a call.
