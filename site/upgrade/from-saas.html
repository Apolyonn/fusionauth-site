        <h2>Their Free is Not Really Free</h2>
        <p>
          Once you get past the 'free developer version,' SaaS solutions become a complex web of pricing tiers, upgrade-only features, and not-my-expertise support staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          FusionAuth gives you all the features of high-cost SaaS platforms plus true data isolation, the ability to deploy anywhere, awesome support, and transparent & scale-friendly pricing that won't break the bank.

          No $10,000 to $20,000 per month price jump just to add one more identity provider or that next monthly-active user. Our pricing is transparent and listed right on our website.
