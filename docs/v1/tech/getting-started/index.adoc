== Introduction

FusionAuth is a modern platform for Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). FusionAuth provides APIs and a responsive web user interface for to support
login, registration, localized email, multi-factor authentication, reporting and much more.

== Overview

Legacy identity technologies have complex hierarchy and cryptic terminology like realms, principals, subjects and distinguished names. Ugh.

In order to simplify something perceived to be complex, the best approach is to go back to the basics, to the atomic elements and throw everything else away.

When we built FusionAuth we took the back to basics approach. If we had the opportunity to build the next generation of CIAM from scratch we
most certainly would not choose to build it using LDAP or SAML; so, we didn't.

We identified two atomic elements of identify, Users and Applications. Everyone has Users, and Users need to be authenticated to Applications.
For this reason FusionAuth is built upon these two elements; Users and Applications.

If this sounds overly simplistic, consider that 99% of the human body is comprised of just six elements. From our two elements, Users
and Applications we are able to satisfy the simplest to the most complex customer requirements.

=== Users

A user is uniquely identified in any particular tenant by an email address or username. A User can be registered to one or more FusionAuth Applications. A User Registrations
can define one to many Application Roles.

=== Applications

A FusionAuth Application represents an authenticated resource such as a web application, mobile application or any other application that requires authenticated users.

A FusionAuth Application is defined by a name and a set of Roles.

Most applications you define in FusionAuth have users that register for and log into it. However, even if your applications have anonymous users such as a free-to-play game, you can still create a User inside FusionAuth using the device Id as the unique identifier for the user (i.e. the `username`). This will allow you to track and manage the user from FusionAuth.

Another example of an application is how you might use use FusionAuth to manage customer accounts for your company. You might use FusionAuth to manage users with accounts on https://my-company.com/accounts. For this Application, you might define a FusionAuth Application named **Website**. This Application might have two roles it will use. These roles could be named:

* **admin**
* **user**

When you authenticate a user to your website, you would verify the user credentials are correct and that they are registered for the **Website** Application. A successful login attempt will return the user's unique id which can be used to retrieve the user's complete profile including their roles for the specific Application. This allows you to control the features and functions you would grant to the user.

== Getting Started

There are two different deployment models of FusionAuth: **FusionAuth Cloud** and **FusionAuth Server**.

=== FusionAuth Cloud

FusionAuth Cloud is a hosted solution that is maintained and monitored by FusionAuth. When you sign up for FusionAuth Cloud, we provisions a Private Cloud Server for you in our Cloud environment. You don't need to download or install FusionAuth if you are using this version. Once your FusionAuth Cloud server is setup, you can immediately access it and begin your integration.

If you are using FusionAuth Cloud, you don't need to install FusionAuth. Instead, you can dive right into our link:../tutorials/[Tutorials] and link:../apis/[API docs] to get started:

* [Tutorial] link:../tutorials/#registering_a_user_and_logging_users_in_via_the_api[Registering a User and Logging Users in via the API]
* [Tech Docs] link:../apis/[API Docs]

=== FusionAuth Server

FusionAuth Server is an on-premise solution that is downloaded and installed on your servers. You can install and configure FusionAuth however you want and can also put FusionAuth behind a firewall or VPN. This solution requires that you download and install FusionAuth yourself as well as maintain and monitor it as well.

If you are using FusionAuth Server, you first need to install and configure FusionAuth before starting your integration. Here are some links to get you started:
