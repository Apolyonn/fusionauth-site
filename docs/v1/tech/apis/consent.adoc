A FusionAuth Consent is a definition of a permission that can be given to a User. At a minimum a consent has a name, and defines the minimum age of self-consent. A consent can then be grated to a User from a family member or optionally a User may self-consent if they meet the minimum age defined by the consent.

The first API allows you to create, delete, update and retrieve a consent. The FusionAuth Consent is the object that defines the consent, the values, minimum ages, etc.

The second API is the User Consent API, this API allows you to grant consent, revoke consent and update a consent on a User.

* <<Grant a User Consent>>
* <<Revoke a User Consent>>
