.Response Body for all Applications
|===
|[field]#applications# [type]#[Array]#
|The list of Application objects.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.id# [type]#[UUID]#
|The Id of the Application.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.active# [type]#[Boolean]#
|Whether or not the Application is active.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.authenticationTokenConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]#
|Whether or not Users can have Authentication Tokens associated with this Application.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.applicationIds# [type]#[Array<UUID>]#

For example, a FusionAuth Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to FusionAuth (when users are disciplined for example). FusionAuth will translate the CleanSpeak ids to FusionAuth ids and then apply the user action.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]#
|True if CleanSpeak integration is enabled. This setting is global and is not modifiable using this API.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]#
|The Id of the CleanSpeak application that usernames are sent to for moderation.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]#
|True if CleanSpeak username moderation is enabled.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.name# [type]#[String]#
|The name of the Application.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.data# [type]#[Object]#

|The length of time in minutes the JWT refresh token will live before it is expired and is not able to be exchanged for a JWT.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.jwtConfiguration.secret# [type]#[String]#

|[field]#applications``[x]``.oauthConfiguration.logoutURL# [type]#[String]#
|The logout URL for the Application. FusionAuth will redirect to this URL after the user logs out of OAuth.

|[field]#applications``[x]``.oauthConfiguration.requireClientAuthentication# [type]#[boolean]# [since]#Available Since 1.3.0#
