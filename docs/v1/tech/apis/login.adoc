== Overview

This page contains the APIs that are used to authenticate and track user logins.

* <<Authenticate a User>>
* <<Complete Two Factor Authentication>>
* <<Update Login Instant>>
* <<Logout a User>>


== Authenticate a User

The Login API is used authenticate a user in FusionAuth.

=== Request

By default, this API will require authentication when called with an `applicationId`. Authentication may be disabled per Application, see `application.loginConfiguration.requireAuthentication` in the Application API or the Security tab in the Application configuration. Prior to version `1.5.0` this API never require an API key.

.Request Headers
|===
|[field]#X-Forwarded-For# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of a client requesting authentication. If the IP address is provided it will be stored for login history of the user. It is
generally preferred to specify the IP address in the request body. If it is not provided in the request body this header value will be used
if available, the request body value will take precedence.

.Request Body
|===
|[field]#applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the Application the user is to be logged into. If this parameter is omitted the user will still be authenticated but a login
count will not be recorded for an Application.

|[field]#device# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional# [deprecated]#Deprecated#
|The unique device identifier for this request. This value should be unique to the device and the same device Id should be sent on subsequent requests for the same device.

Using this parameter will indicate you wish to receive a refresh token on the response. The refresh token will be written on the HTTP response as an HTTP only persistent cookie named `refresh_token`, and also be provided in the JSON response body.

[deprecated]#Removed in version 1.5.0# This parameter is no longer required to receive a Refresh Token, if it is provided on the request it will be ignored. In version 1.5.0 and later Refresh Tokens are issued by the Login API based upon the Application configuration. See `loginConfiguration` settings in the link:./applications[Application API].

|[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The IP address of the end-user that is logging into FusionAuth. If this value is omitted FusionAuth will attempt to obtain the IP address of
the client, the value will be that of the `X-Forwarded-For` header if provided or the last proxy that sent the request. The IP address will
be stored in the User login history.

|[field]#loginId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The login identifier of the user. The login identifier can be either the `email` or the `username`.

|[field]#metaData.device.description# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|A human readable description of the device used during login. This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.

|[field]#metaData.device.name# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|A human readable name of the device used during login.  This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.

|[field]#metaData.device.type# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The type of device used during login. The following types may be specified:

* `BROWSER`
* `DESKTOP`
* `LAPTOP`
* `MOBILE`
* `OTHER`
* `SERVER`
* `TABLET`
* `TV`
* `UNKNOWN`

This meta data is used to describe the refresh token that may be generated for this login request.

|[field]#noJWT# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|When this value is set to true a JWT will not be issued as part of this request. The response body will not contain the `token` or `refreshToken` fields, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies will not be written to the HTTP response.

This optional parameter may be helpful when performing high volume authentication requests and the JWT is not being utilized, in this scenario removing the additional latency required to issue and sign the JWT may have a measurable cumulative effect on performance.

|[field]#password# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The user's password or an Application specific link:../tutorials/authentication-tokens[Authentication Token].

|[field]#twoFactorTrustId# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Two Factor Trust identifier returned by the Two Factor Login API response. This value be may be provided to bypass the Two Factor challenge when a User has Two Factor enabled.

== Complete Two Factor Authentication

The Two Factor Login API is used to complete the authentication process when a `242` is returned by the Login API.

=== Request

|[field]#ipAddress# [type]#[String]# [optional]#Optional#

|[field]#trustComputer# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|When this value is set to true the response will contain a Two Factor Trust identifier. This can be used on subsequent Login requests to
allow the Two Factor challenge to be bypassed.

|[field]#twoFactorId# [type]#[String]# [required]#Required#
|The two factor Id generated and returned in the response body during the initial authentication attempt.

The default duration of this identifier is 5 minutes. This means that you have 5 minutes to complete the request to this API after
calling the Login API. Once the identifier has expired you will need to call the Login API again to restart the process.

This duration can be modified using the System Configuration API or in the FusionAuth UI.

== Update Login Instant

Sends a ping to FusionAuth indicating that the user was automatically logged into an application. When using FusionAuth's SSO or your own, you
should call this if the user is already logged in centrally, but accesses an application where they no longer have a session. This helps
correctly track login counts, times and helps with reporting.
