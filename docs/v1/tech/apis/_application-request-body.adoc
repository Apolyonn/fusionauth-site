For example, a FusionAuth Application for a game might have one CleanSpeak Application for usernames and another Application for chat.

This property is used when CleanSpeak sends user action notifications to FusionAuth (when users are disciplined for example). FusionAuth will translate the CleanSpeak ids to FusionAuth ids and then apply the user action.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.applicationId# [type]#[UUID]# [optional]#Optional#
|The Id of the CleanSpeak application that usernames are sent to for moderation.

|[field]#application.cleanSpeakConfiguration.usernameModeration.enabled# [type]#[Boolean]# [optional]#Optional# [default]#defaults to `false`#
|True if CleanSpeak username moderation is enabled.

|[field]#application.data# [type]#[Object]# [optional]#Optional#
|An object that can hold any information about the Application that should be persisted.
