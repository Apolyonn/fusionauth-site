title: OpenID Connect Identity Provider APIs
description: APIs for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting OpenID Connect identity providers
---

== Overview

[NOTE.since]
====
This API has been available since 1.1.0
====

OpenID Connect identity providers connect to external OpenID Connect login systems. This type of login will optionally provide a `Login with ...` button on FusionAuth's login page. This button is customizable by using different properties of the identity provider.

Optionally, this identity provider can define one or more domains it is associated with. This is useful for allowing employees to log in with their corporate credentials. As long as the company has an identity solution that provides OpenID Connect, you can leverage this feature. This is referred to as a **Domain Based Identity Provider**. If you enable domains for an identity provider, the `Login with ...` button will not be displayed. Instead, only the `email` form field will be displayed initially on the FusionAuth login page. Once the user types in their email address, FusionAuth will determine if the user is logging in locally or if they should be redirected to this identity provider. This is determined by extracting the domain from their email address and comparing it to the domains associated with the identity provider.

FusionAuth will also leverage the `/userinfo` API that is part of the OpenID Connect specification. This API provides user information that is stored in FusionAuth. Since FusionAuth is also an OpenID Connect provider, it translates most of the OpenID Connect claims over. Here are the OpenID Connect claims that FusionAuth stores from an external OpenID Connect identity provider and the User object fields they are stored in:

* `birthdate` -> `birthDate`
* `email` -> `email`
* `family_name` -> `lastName`
* `given_name` -> `firstName`
* `locale` -> `preferredLanguages`
* `middle_name` -> `middleName`
* `name` -> `fullName`
* `phone_number` -> `mobilePhone`
* `picture` -> `imageUrl`

If the external OpenID Connect identity provider returns a refresh token, it will be stored in the `UserRegistration` object inside the `tokens` Map. This Map stores the tokens from the various identity providers so that you can use them in your application to call their APIs.
