== Overview

=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resources Sharing] (CORS) provide a mechanism to control permission
to resources on a server on a different domain or origin than the originating request.

Practically this means that in order to make HTTP requests in JavaScript to FusionAuth when the request
is coming from a different domain CORS needs to be configured to allow the request.

== FusionAuth >= v1.8.0
In FusionAuth >= v1.8.0 we enable a customizable CORS Configuration through the FusionAuth UI.

=== Configure CORS Settings
To modify the default CORS configuration navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#System# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#CORS#.

=== CORS Excluded URI Paths
We have excluded some paths from FusionAuth CORS filtering in order to force same-origin browser requests on these paths. The following are the URL patterns excluded from our CORS filter.

* `/account*`
* `/admin*`
* `/support*`
* `/ajax*`

== FusionAuth < v1.8.0
In FusionAuth < v1.8.0 we ship a fixed CORS Configuration.

=== CORS Included URI Paths
The following URLs or URL patterns pass through the CORS filter.

////
Internal Note: This needs to match our shipped CORS configuration. See /fusionauth-app/web/WEB-INF/web.xml

* `/api/*`
* `/oauth2/introspect`
* `/oauth2/userinfo`
* `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* `/.well-known/jwks`
