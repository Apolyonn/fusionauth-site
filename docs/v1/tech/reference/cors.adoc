== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[Cross-Origin Resources Sharing] (CORS) provide a mechanism to control permission
to resources on a server on a different domain or origin than the originating request.

Practically this means that in order to make HTTP requests in JavaScript to FusionAuth when the request
is coming from a different domain CORS needs to be configured to allow the request.

The following URLs or URL patterns are allowed through the CORS filter.

////
Internal Note: This needs to match our shipped CORS configuration. See /fusionauth-app/web/WEB-INF/web.xml
////
