== Setup Wizard

This tutorial guides you through completing the initial FusionAuth configuration necessary prior to making API calls and beginning your integration.

=== Access FusionAuth App

The first step is to access FusionAuth in your web browser. If we are hosting FusionAuth in our private cloud, the URL will be
located on your https://fusionauth.io/account[FusionAuth Account] labeled Web interface. If you have installed FusionAuth on your own system,
you will need to know the IP address or hostname of the system where it has been installed. For example, to access FusionAuth on localhost, you
would use the following URL http://localhost:9011.

Once you have a web browser open to FusionAuth you will be presented with a setup wizard that will walk you through getting FusionAuth
configured and ready to begin calling the API and managing users. Once the setup wizard is complete you will be logged into FusionAuth using
the created Administrator account.

=== Complete the Setup Wizard

==== Administrator account
This will be the first account to be created in FusionAuth and this user will be assigned the `admin` role the FusionAuth application. Additional
users can be assigned the `admin` role at a later time.

==== Session Timezone
This value will default to a best guess based upon your location. Modify this value if necessary. Each time you log into FusionAuth
a Timezone will be selected that will be used to localize date and times displayed in the user interface.

== Complete Setup

Once the Setup Wizard has logged you into FusionAuth you may begin using FusionAuth. On the dashboard you will see the remaining setup items.
This includes setting up an API key, creating an Application and completing the SMTP Email configuration.

=== Application
FusionAuth can be configured with one to many Applications. A FusionAuth Application represents a secured resource, it should be thoughtfully
named but the name may be modified at a later time.

You may optionally define roles now. These may be added or modified later as well, so if you're not ready to create the roles that is ok.

=== API Key
In order to call the API at least one API key will need to be added. Additional API keys can be added at a later time by any user with the `admin` role.

=== Email Settings
This step is optional but it is recommended. Until FusionAuth has been configured with a valid SMTP configuration FusionAuth will be unable to send
email. This means features such as Forgot Password, Change Password, Verify Email and User Actions configured to send emails will not function.
