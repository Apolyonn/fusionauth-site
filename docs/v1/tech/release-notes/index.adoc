== Version 1.0.15
_Pending Release_

=== Fixed
* The first time a user reached the failed login threshold and a `409` response code was returned the response body was empty. Subsequent login requests correctly returned the JSON response body with the `409`, now the JSON response body is correctly returned the first time the user reaches the failed login threshold.
