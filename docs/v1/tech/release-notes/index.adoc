== Version 1.1.0
_Pending Release_

include::docs/v1/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* Social login support
** link:../apis/identity-providers/facebook[Facebook] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/google[Google] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/twitter[Twitter] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/openid-connect[OpenID Connect] Identity Provider
* Full theme support for login. See the link:../tutorials/login-theme[Login Theme] tutorial for additional information and examples.
* Better localization support in the FusionAuth UI. You now have the option to set or modify your preferred language for use in the FusionAuth UI.
Providing a preferred language will cause dates to be formatted based upon your preference. For example, the default data format is `M/D/YYYY`, but
if you are not in the United States this may not be the way you expect a date to be formatted. If you set your locale to `French` you will now
see a more appropriate format of `D/M/YYYY`. This value is stored on the User Registration for FusionAuth in the `preferredLanguages` field.

=== Enhanced
* When viewing sessions (refresh tokens) on the Manage User panel, the start and expiration times will be displayed.

== Version 1.0.18
_October 29th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* If FusionAuth starts up in maintenance mode and stays there for an extended period of time without the User completing the configuration from the web browser, FusionAuth may get stuck in maintenance mode. If you encounter this issue, where you seemingly are entering the correct credentials on the Database configuration page and are unable to continue, restart FusionAuth and the issue will be resolved.

== Version 1.0.15
_October 1st, 2018_

=== New
* Better support for running in Docker. Configuration can be override using environment variables. See link:../installation-guide/docker[Docker Install] for additional information.

=== Fixed
* The first time a user reached the failed login threshold and a `409` response code was returned the response body was empty. Subsequent login requests correctly returned the JSON response body with the `409`, now the JSON response body is correctly returned the first time the user reaches the failed login threshold.
