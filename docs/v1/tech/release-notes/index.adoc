== Version Next
_Pending Release_

* Something awesome I'm sure...

=== Changed
* API key will take precedence for API authentication if both a JWT and an API key are provided on the request. For example, when making a GET request to the User API, if a JWT is provided in a cookie, and a valid API key is also provided in the `Authorization` HTTP header, the previous design was to prefer the JWT. This design point meant that even when an API key was provided, even when providing a valid API key, you would be unable to retrieve any user but the one represented by the JWT.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/43[GitHub Issue #43 : Id is ignored on Retrieve User when JWT is present]
* The `client_id` is no longer required on the OAuth Token endpoint when client authentication is configured as required, or the `client_id` has been provided in the HTTP Basic Authorization header.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/54[Github Issue #54 :Token request returning 500 when client_id is omitted]

=== Fixed
* When editing the JWT settings in the FusionAuth application the UI a JavaScript error may cause some of the settings to not render properly. This error was introduced in version `1.3.0`.
* Added missing properties to the Application view dialog in the FusionAuth UI.
* Validation for the OAuth2 Token endpoint may fail when the `client_id` request body parameter is omitted.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/54[Github Issue #54 : Token request returning 500 when client_id is omitted]
* When a OAuth2 redirect URI is registered with a query parameter, the resulting redirect URI will not be built correctly.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/55[Github Issue #55 : Adding a query parameter to the redirect_uri causes an invalid URI to be returned]
* When trying to configure Elasticsearch engine during maintenance mode the index may get created but fail to leave maintenance mode. FusionAuth makes a `HEAD` request to Elasticsearch to check if the required indexes exist during startup and prior to leaving maintenance mode. When connected to an AWS Elasticsearch cluster this request does not behave as expected which causes FusionAuth to stay in maintenance mode. This issue has been resolved and should allow FusionAuth to properly connect to and utilize Elasticsearch running in an AWS cluster.


[role=release-note]

== Version 1.3.0
_December 5th, 2018_

=== New
* An Application may disable the issue of refresh tokens through configuration. See `oauthConfiguration.generateRefreshTokens` in the link:../apis/applications[Application API] or the `Generate refresh tokens` toggle in the FusionAuth UI when editing an application.
* The OAuth2 client secret may be optionally regenerated using the FusionAuth UI during Application edit.
* Support for OAuth2 confidential clients, this is supported by optionally requiring client authentication via configuration. See `oauthConfiguration.requireClientAuthentication` in the link:../apis/applications[Application API] or the `Require authentication` toggle in the FusionAuth UI when editing an application.

=== Fixed
* Calling the link:../oauth/endpoints#introspect[Introspect] endpoint with a JWT returned from the Issue API may fail due to the missing `aud` claim.
* The MySQL schema previously was using `random_bytes` which is not available in MariaDB. These usages have been replaced with an equivalent that will function the same in MySQL and MariaDB.
** Thanks to https://github.com/Garogat[@Garogat] for bringing this to our attention and suggesting and verifying a solution via https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/48[GitHub Issue #48 : Support for MariaDB]
* When editing or adding a new user in the FusionAuth UI, the `Birthdate` field may get set automatically before the date selector is utilized. A JavaScript error was causing this condition and it has been fixed.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/41[GitHub Issue #41 : Birthday is autofilled when adding or editing a user]

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.2.2
_November 27th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* Add `X-FusionAuth-TenantId` to allowed CORS headers.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/44[GitHub Issue #44 : CORS blocks API request containing X-FusionAuth-TenantId]
* When FusionAuth is running behind a proxy such as an AWS ALB / ELB the redirect URI required to complete login may not be resolved correctly. This may cause the redirect back to the FusionAuth UI login to fail with a CSRF exception. If you encounter this issue you may see an error message that says `Something doesn't seem right. You have been logged out of FusionAuth`. The work-around for this issue if you encounter it will be to perform the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in your load balancer.
* Some minor usability issues in the Identity Provider configuration UI.

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.2.1
_November 16th, 2018_

=== Enhancement
* Better error handling when an API caller sends invalid JSON messages. Prior to this enhancement if FusionAuth did not provide a specific error message for a particular field a `500` HTTP status code was returned if the JSON could not be parsed properly. This enhancement will ensure that sending a FusionAuth API invalid JSON will consistently result in a `400` status code with a JSON body describing the error.
** Resolves https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/17[GitHub Issue #17 : Malformed or invalid JSON causes 500 error]
* Allow an Identity Provider to be enabled and disabled from the UI. You may still choose to enable or disable a specific Application for use with an Identity Provider, but with this enhancement you may not turn off an Identity Provider for all Applications with one switch.

=== Fixed
* Preserve Application Identity Provider configuration for disabled Applications when editing a Identity Provider from the UI.


== Version 1.2.0
_November 15th, 2018_

=== New
* Add TTL configuration for Refresh Tokens to the Application configuration. When you enable JWT configuration per Application this value will override the global setting.

=== Fixed
* An error in the Twitter OAuth v1 workflow has been resolved.

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.1.1
_November 13th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* If you were to have an Identity Provider for federated third party JSON Web Tokens configured prior to upgrading to `1.1.0` FusionAuth may fail during the database migration to version `1.1.0`.

== Version 1.1.0
_November 13th, 2018_

include::docs/v1/tech/release-notes/__database-migration-warning.adoc[]

=== New
* Social login support
** link:../apis/identity-providers/facebook[Facebook] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/google[Google] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/twitter[Twitter] Identity Provider
** link:../apis/identity-providers/openid-connect[OpenID Connect] Identity Provider
* Full theme support for login. See the link:../tutorials/login-theme[Login Theme] tutorial for additional information and examples.
* Better localization support in the FusionAuth UI. You now have the option to set or modify your preferred language for use in the FusionAuth UI.
Providing a preferred language will cause dates to be formatted based upon your preference. For example, the default data format is `M/D/YYYY`, but
if you are not in the United States this may not be the way you expect a date to be formatted. If you set your locale to `French` you will now
see a more appropriate format of `D/M/YYYY`. This value is stored on the User Registration for FusionAuth in the `preferredLanguages` field.

=== Enhancement
* When viewing sessions (refresh tokens) on the Manage User panel, the start and expiration times will be displayed.

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.0.18
_October 29th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* If FusionAuth starts up in maintenance mode and stays there for an extended period of time without the User completing the configuration from the web browser, FusionAuth may get stuck in maintenance mode. If you encounter this issue, where you seemingly are entering the correct credentials on the Database configuration page and are unable to continue, restart FusionAuth and the issue will be resolved.

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.0.17
_October 5th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* When running in Docker Compose, FusionAuth cannot connect to the search service when trying to exit the setup wizard.
** https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/issues/2

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.0.16
_October 5th, 2018_

=== Enhancement
* Better support for running in Docker. Enhanced silent configuration capability for database and search engine boot strap configuration in Docker Compose to be more resilient.

=== Fixed
* If custom data is added to an Application, Group or Tenant before editing the corresponding object in the UI, the custom data may be lost.

[role=release-note]

== Version 1.0.15
_October 1st, 2018_

=== New
* Better support for running in Docker. Configuration can be override using environment variables. See link:../installation-guide/docker[Docker Install] for additional information.

=== Fixed
* The first time a user reached the failed login threshold and a `409` response code was returned the response body was empty. Subsequent login requests correctly returned the JSON response body with the `409`, now the JSON response body is correctly returned the first time the user reaches the failed login threshold.


[role=release-note]

== Version 1.0.14
_September 17th, 2018_

=== Fixed
* When using PostgreSQL an exception may occur during an internal cache reload request. If you encounter this issue you will see a stack trace in the `fusionauth-app.log`. If you see this error and need assistance, please open an issue in the FusionAuth https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues[Issues] GitHub project.
