Until this tutorial is available, please find the Google Identity provider in the FusionAuth UI by navigating to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Identity Providers# and click `Add provider` and select `Google` from the dialog.

From there you may fill out the required fields after configuring new OAuth 2.0 client credentials via the Google Cloud console. You will only need to collect the `Client ID` and `Client secret` from the Google Cloud console.
