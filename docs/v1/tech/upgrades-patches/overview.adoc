== FusionAuth Updates and Patches

Periodically, FusionAuth releases updates and you might also require a patch if you are running into problems and have contacted FusionAuth Support for assistance. In these cases, you will need to update the application.

To download or check on the latest updates, please visit https://fusionauth.io/downloads[Downloads].

=== Linux

=== Database

[NOTE]
====
In most cases, you will not need to upgrade you database manually using the information below. FusionAuth ships with a system called Maintenance
 Mode. When you restart FusionAuth after installing a new bundle using the steps above, FusionAuth will automatically upgrade your database.

You should always backup your database prior to using Maintenance Mode.
====

Depending on your current version and the new version you will be updating to you might need to execute one or more SQL scripts to update your
 database. These scripts are located in the migrations folder inside the Database Schema ZIP file. This file can be downloaded by logging into your account at fusionauth.io.

[WARNING]
====
When upgrading your database from a previous version, be sure to only run the scripts located in the `migrations` folder, the base files
 `mysql.sql` and `postgresql.sql` should only be used during a clean installation when no database schema is present.
====

Inside of the database schema zip file, you will find the following FusionAuth migrations, run in this order, starting with the first migration that is
greater than the version you are coming from, and ending with the version that is less than or equal to the target version.
