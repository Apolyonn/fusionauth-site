* <<User Login Failure>> - when a user fails to complete login
* <<User Registration Create>> - when a new user registration is created
* <<User Registration Update>> - when a user registration is update
* <<User Registration Delete>> - when a user registration is deleted
* <<JWT Public Key Update>> - when a JWT RSA Public / Private keypair used for signing may have been updated.
* <<JWT Refresh Token Revoke>> - when a refresh token (or multiple tokens) are revoked

TODO add @since for any newer events such as user login failure, user login success, reg update, delete and update, etc.

== User Actions

This event is generated when a User Action is taken on a user and when temporal actions transition between phases.

For example, a temporal action event may be sent when the action starts, ends, is canceled or modified.

When the action is started by an admin, the phase will be "start". If an admin changes the duration of the action, the phase will be "modify". If an admin cancels an action it will be "cancel" or the action expires, the phase will be "end". If the action is key-based, the phase will be "start".
