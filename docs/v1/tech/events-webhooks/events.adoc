TODO add @since for any newer events such as user login failure, user login success, reg update, delete and update, etc.

== User Actions

This event is generated when a User Action is taken on a user and when temporal actions transition between phases.

A temporal action is one that has a start time and and a duration, when a phase transition occurs an event will be sent to the webhook. See the [field]#event.phase# in the message body.
