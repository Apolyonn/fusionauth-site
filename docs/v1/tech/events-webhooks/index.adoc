== Overview

Events and Webhooks are a core architecture feature of FusionAuth. This feature provides a publish-subscribe pattern to developers and integrators of FusionAuth. In this architecture pattern, the Webhook is the subscriber and FusionAuth is the publisher.

This system is designed to provide feedback to your system when events occur within FusionAuth. Events are sent via an HTTP `POST` request with a JSON request body. The request will be sent with the a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`. This is the same style of API that the FusionAuth App uses to handle API requests from your application.

See the corresponding link:../apis/webhooks[Webhook APIs] if you'd prefer to programatically configure FusionAuth Webhooks.

Here are the topics in this section:

* link:events[Events] - Covers all of the event types that FusionAuth sends to Webhooks
* link:writing-a-webhook[Writing a Webhook] - Covers how to write a Webhook that will process events from FusionAuth.

Continue reading below to see how the events and webhooks are configured using the FusionAuth user interface.

* <<Add Webhook>>

== System Settings

To prepare to consume FusionAuth events you'll first need to enable the event globally and select a transaction level that is compatible with your requirements. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#System# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Webhooks# to enable events and optionally modify the default transaction level for each event type.

|===
|Event type
|The event type, this value will be present in the JSON request to identify the message.

|Enabled
|When enabled this event can be sent by one or more webhook. You will also need to enable the event for a specific webhook to receive the event.

This toggle allows you to optionally disable an event for all webhooks all at once.

|Transaction setting
|The transaction setting for this event. This setting will apply to all webhooks consuming this event type.

! Value ! Description

![field]#No Webhooks are required to succeed#
!The event will succeed regardless of the webhook response status code. Use this setting when it is not important for a webhook to succeed or provide confirmation that the event has been received and processed successfully.

![field]#Any single Webhook must succeed#
!The event will succeed as long as one or more of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive).

![field]#A simple majority of Webhooks must succeed#
!The event will succeed if at least half of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). This means 50% or more of the webhooks must respond successfully.

![field]#A two-thirds majority of Webhooks must succeed#
!The event will succeed if a super majority of the webhooks respond with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). A super majority is two-thirds (66.7%) or more of the configured webhooks.

![field]#All of the Webhooks must succeed#
!The event will succeed if every configured webhook responds with a status code between `200` and `299` (inclusive). Use this setting when it is critical for every configured webhook to receive and process the event before considering it complete.

== Add Webhook

After you have enabled the events that you will be using, create a webhook definition to indicate where FusionAuth should send the JSON events. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings# icon:chevron-right[role=breadcrumb] [breadcrumb]#Webhooks# to create a new webhook.

See the example screenshot below, at a minimum you will need to provide the URL the endpoint that will accept the FusionAuth JSON events. You can see in this screenshot that even though an event may be enabled globally you can still select which events will be sent to this webhook.

If you need to configure an Authorization header or other credentials to allow FusionAuth to make a request to your webhook, you may do so in the Security tab.
