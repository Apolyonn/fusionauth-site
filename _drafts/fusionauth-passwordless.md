Logging in without a password? In what fantasy land can that be secure?!? The fact is it can be much more secure than traditional passwords, and is now supported in our newest release. FusionAuth 1.5 is now available for [direct download](/downloads) and through our [FastPath one-line install](/). It includes new features, a few changes, and minor fixes for issues discovered by QA testers and our growing community of users. Get the brief overview below, and visit our [release notes](/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/#version-1-5-0) for the full details.

## New Feature - Passwordless Login

For years, one of the most common ways hackers use to access servers, data, and accounts has been to guess, steal, phish, or otherwise obtain the username and password of an authorized user. Unfortunately selecting, changing, upodating, remembering, and managing passwords for the multiple accounts that most people have these days has become a monumental task of it's own, and too many people end up ignoring safe password guidelines, leading to more hacking and more data breaches.

**So why don't we get rid of passwords altogether? Ok, good idea. Done.**

The FusionAuth 1.5 release now allows passwordless login via user email, providing a secure way to authenticate users without complex password r3qu!r3mENt5 that nobody can remember. Users simply put in their username and they get a secure email with a link back to the site. When they click the link, they are authenticated and can enter the site or application without issue. If someone else tries to access the site with their username, they'll never see the email, and won't be able to get in. An additional benefit of this process is since no passwords are stored, even if a user database is breached, it doesn't reveal any authentication credentials. It's just a list of usernames, nothing more.

In case this is brand new to you, passwordless login isn't something we just invented. It's been used by Microsoft in Outlook, Office, Skype, and Xbox Live and is a keystone technology of [WebAuthn](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249895/web-authentication-webauthn-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-standard-browsers) supported by Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge browsers. ([Read more here](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/11/22/the-passwordless-web-explained/) if you want additional details.) As passwords continue to be proven insecure, more sites and applications will rely on passwordless authentication solutions in one form or another.

Why isn't it used by everyone already? Basically because the underlying code is more difficult to securely implement than traditional passwords, which is also why we added it to FusionAuth. We wanted to take the pain out of setting up passwordless authentication so every site and application could take advantage of the additional security.

## Fixes & Updates

While we are pretty excited about passwordless login, the FusionAuth 1.5 release has many other updates and fixes that you should know about. Here are just a few to get you started, and visit our [release notes](/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/#version-1-5-0) for the full details.

- The database schema has changed and an upgrade is required for this version of FusionAuth. You will be prompted to upgrade the database by maintenance mode before you may login.
- We corrected the Refresh API response body to match the documentation. If you are currently consuming the JSON body of this API using the POST method, you will need to update your integration to match the documented response body.
- Added support for the OAuth2 Implicit Grant. See the OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect Overview and OAuth 2.0 Endpoints for additional information.
- Authorization Code, Password, Implicit and Refresh Token grants can now be enabled or disabled per application.
- Change Password API can be called using a JWT providing additional support for the Change Password workflow in a single page web application.
- The Change Password API can return a One Time password (OTP) allowing for a more seamless user experience when performing a change password workflow.
- When using the Change Password workflow the user will be automatically logged in upon completing the change password required during login.
- We improved the Two Factor Login API to provide additional support and ease of use in a single page web application.
- We adjusted the workflow when a user has 2FA enabled and a password change is required during login. Now the 2FA will occur before the change password workflow.
- The `id_token` is now signed with the `client_secret` when HS256, HS384 or HS512 is selected as the signing algorithm. This is necessary for compliance with OpenID Connect Core 3.1.3.7 ID Token Validation. This fixes [Github Issue #57](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/57 "Jump to GitHub"). Thanks to [Garogat](https://github.com/Garogat) for reporting this issue.
- A change to the Docker build for permissions reduced the overall FusionAuth app image by ~200 MB.
